==================================================
### Analysis
The user’s request suggests a challenge related to the limitations of knowledge and the nature of questions. The phrase "you can't ask me a question that you don't know the answer to" implies a need for clarification or a deeper understanding of the context in which questions are posed. This could relate to knowledge gaps, assumptions in questioning, or the dynamics of inquiry.

### Approach
To address the user’s request, we can take the following steps:

1. **Clarify the Context**: Determine the specific area or topic where the user feels questions may be inadequately informed.
2. **Engage in Dialogue**: Create a framework for asking questions that are informed by existing knowledge while allowing for exploration of unknowns.
3. **Iterative Learning**: Develop a method for refining questions based on user feedback and responses, ensuring that inquiries are relevant and insightful.

### Implementation
To implement this approach, we can create a skill that facilitates a structured dialogue. This skill will help in generating questions based on known data and will adapt based on user responses.

#### SKILL_SPEC
- **Skill Name**: Informed Inquiry Generator
- **Objective**: To generate relevant questions based on existing knowledge and user input.
- **Functionality**:
  - Accepts user context or topic.
  - Generates questions that are informed by existing data.
  - Allows users to provide feedback on the relevance of questions.
  - Adapts future questions based on user feedback.

#### Sample Code
```python
class InformedInquiryGenerator:
    def __init__(self, knowledge_base):
        self.knowledge_base = knowledge_base  # Dictionary of topics and known facts

    def generate_question(self, topic):
        if topic in self.knowledge_base:
            # Generate a question based on known facts
            facts = self.knowledge_base[topic]
            question = f"What are your thoughts on {facts['key_point']} in relation to {topic}?"
            return question
        else:
            return "I'm not sure about that topic. Can you provide more context?"

    def adapt_question(self, user_feedback, topic):
        # Logic to adapt questions based on user feedback
        if user_feedback == "not relevant":
            return self.generate_question(topic)  # Regenerate question
        else:
            return "Glad you found it relevant! What else would you like to explore?"

# Example usage
knowledge_base = {
    "AI Ethics": {"key_point": "the implications of bias in AI systems"},
    "Climate Change": {"key_point": "the impact of carbon emissions on global temperatures"}
}

inquiry_generator = InformedInquiryGenerator(knowledge_base)
print(inquiry_generator.generate_question("AI Ethics"))
```

This implementation provides a foundation for engaging users in meaningful dialogue while ensuring that questions are rooted in existing knowledge.
