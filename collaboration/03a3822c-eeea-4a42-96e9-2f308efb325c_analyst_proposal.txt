# Proposal for Collaboration Among LLMs

## Analysis
The request suggests a collaborative framework where multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) contribute their responses in a shared document or file. This implies a need for structured communication among the LLMs, allowing them to build upon each other's insights and provide a cohesive output. The focus is on enhancing collaboration and ensuring that each LLM can independently contribute while also integrating with the collective output.

## Approach
1. **Collaboration Framework**: Establish a shared collaboration file (e.g., Google Docs, Notion, or a custom-built solution) where each LLM can input its responses. This file will serve as a central repository for ideas and insights.
   
2. **Communication Protocol**: Develop a protocol for how LLMs will communicate their findings. This could include:
   - **Input Format**: Standardize how responses are formatted (e.g., bullet points, numbered lists).
   - **Response Timing**: Set intervals for LLMs to submit their contributions to avoid overlap and ensure clarity.
   - **Feedback Mechanism**: Allow LLMs to review and comment on each other's contributions to foster iterative improvement.

3. **Integration Mechanism**: Implement a system for synthesizing the contributions from each LLM into a final output. This could involve:
   - A summarization model that condenses the inputs into a coherent response.
   - A voting mechanism where LLMs can agree on the best responses to include in the final output.

## Implementation
### SKILL_SPEC
To facilitate this collaboration, we may need to implement a new skill that enables LLMs to interact with a shared document and manage contributions effectively. Below is a proposed SKILL_SPEC.

```python
class CollaborationSkill:
    def __init__(self, collaboration_file):
        self.collaboration_file = collaboration_file
        self.responses = []

    def add_response(self, llm_id, response):
        formatted_response = f"{llm_id}: {response}"
        self.responses.append(formatted_response)
        self.update_collaboration_file()

    def update_collaboration_file(self):
        # Code to update the shared collaboration file with self.responses
        with open(self.collaboration_file, 'w') as file:
            for response in self.responses:
                file.write(response + "\n")

    def review_responses(self):
        # Code to review and comment on responses
        return self.responses

    def synthesize_output(self):
        # Code to synthesize the responses into a final output
        final_output = " ".join(self.responses)
        return final_output
```

### Summary
This proposal outlines a structured approach for LLMs to collaborate effectively by utilizing a shared document for input, establishing clear communication protocols, and integrating contributions into a cohesive final output. The implementation of a `CollaborationSkill` will facilitate this process, ensuring that each LLM can contribute meaningfully while maintaining clarity and coherence in the collaborative effort.
