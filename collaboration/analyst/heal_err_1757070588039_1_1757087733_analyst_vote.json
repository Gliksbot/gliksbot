  "content": "Analysis: The root cause of the error is a `ModuleNotFoundError`, indicating that the Python module `dexter_brain` is not available in the current environment. This could be due to several reasons, including the module not being installed, an incorrect Python path, or the module being removed or renamed.\n\nImmediate_Action: \n1. Verify if the `dexter_brain` module is installed by running `pip list` or `pip show dexter_brain` in the command line.\n2. If the module is not installed, install it using `pip install dexter_brain`.\n3. If the module is installed, check the Python environment being used to ensure it matches the environment where the module is installed.\n\nPermanent_Fix: \n1. Ensure that the `dexter_brain` module is included in the projectâ€™s requirements file (e.g., `requirements.txt`) and that it is installed in all environments where the application runs.\n2. Implement a version control system for dependencies to prevent future discrepancies.\n3. Consider using a virtual environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`) to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts.\n\nPrevention: \n1. Set up automated tests that include checks for required modules before deployment.\n2. Implement a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that verifies module availability and compatibility.\n3. Create monitoring alerts for critical errors that can notify the development team when similar issues arise.\n\nRisk_Level: MEDIUM - While installing the module is straightforward, there could be compatibility issues with other dependencies or the application itself.\n\nConfidence: HIGH - The proposed solutions are standard practices in Python development and should effectively resolve the issue.\n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
