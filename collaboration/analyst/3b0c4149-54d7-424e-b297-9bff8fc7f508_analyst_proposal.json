  "content": "### Analysis\nThe user has requested a script that counts the number of words in a text file. This task involves reading the contents of a file, processing the text to identify words, and then providing a count of those words. The definition of a \"word\" typically includes sequences of characters separated by whitespace or punctuation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **File Handling**: Open the specified text file for reading.\n2. **Text Processing**: Read the content of the file and split it into words. This can be done using string manipulation methods that handle whitespace and punctuation.\n3. **Counting Words**: Count the number of words identified in the previous step.\n4. **Output**: Display the total word count to the user.\n\n### Implementation\nThe following Python script implements the above approach:\n\n```python\ndef count_words_in_file(file_path):\n    try:\n        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:\n            text = file.read()\n            # Split the text into words based on whitespace and punctuation\n            words = text.split()\n            word_count = len(words)\n            return word_count\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        return \"Error: The file was not found.\"\n    except Exception as e:\n        return f\"An error occurred: {e}\"\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    file_path = 'path/to/your/textfile.txt'  # Replace with your file path\n    print(f\"Total word count: {count_words_in_file(file_path)}\")\n```\n\n### SKILL_SPEC\n- **Skill Required**: Basic file handling and string manipulation in Python.\n- **Libraries Used**: No external libraries are needed; the script uses built-in Python functions.\n\nThis script provides a straightforward solution to counting words in a text file and can be easily modified for additional features, such as counting unique words or handling different file encodings."
