  "content": "### Analysis\nThe user has requested a simple Python calculator that includes error handling. This implies that the calculator should be able to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) while also managing potential errors such as invalid input (non-numeric values) and division by zero.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Functionality**: The calculator will support four basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n2. **User Input**: The program will prompt the user for two numbers and the desired operation.\n3. **Error Handling**: \n   - Check if the inputs are valid numbers.\n   - Handle division by zero gracefully.\n   - Provide user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs.\n4. **Looping**: The calculator will run in a loop, allowing the user to perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit.\n\n### Implementation\nHere is the proposed implementation of the calculator:\n\n```python\ndef calculator():\n    while True:\n        print(\"Simple Python Calculator\")\n        print(\"Select operation:\")\n        print(\"1. Addition\")\n        print(\"2. Subtraction\")\n        print(\"3. Multiplication\")\n        print(\"4. Division\")\n        print(\"5. Exit\")\n\n        choice = input(\"Enter choice (1/2/3/4/5): \")\n\n        if choice == '5':\n            print(\"Exiting the calculator. Goodbye!\")\n            break\n\n        if choice not in ['1', '2', '3', '4']:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please select a valid operation.\")\n            continue\n\n        try:\n            num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n            num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter numeric values.\")\n            continue\n\n        if choice == '1':\n            result = num1 + num2\n            print(f\"The result of {num1} + {num2} is: {result}\")\n        elif choice == '2':\n            result = num1 - num2\n            print(f\"The result of {num1} - {num2} is: {result}\")\n        elif choice == '3':\n            result = num1 * num2\n            print(f\"The result of {num1} * {num2} is: {result}\")\n        elif choice == '4':\n            if num2 == 0:\n                print(\"Error! Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n            else:\n                result = num1 / num2\n                print(f\"The result of {num1} / {num2} is: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculator()\n```\n\n### Summary\nThis implementation provides a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations and robust error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero. The program runs in a loop until the user decides to exit, ensuring a user-friendly experience."
