  "content": "Analysis: The error is caused by the `auth_manager` variable not being defined in the scope of the `login` function in `main.py`. This indicates that the code is attempting to access an object or module that has not been instantiated or imported correctly. The frequent occurrence of this error suggests that there may be a missing import statement or that the `auth_manager` is not being initialized before it is used.\n\nImmediate_Action: To mitigate the issue immediately, check the `main.py` file for the definition or import of `auth_manager`. If it is missing, add the necessary import statement or initialization code at the beginning of the file or within the appropriate context. If `auth_manager` is supposed to be an instance of a class, ensure that it is instantiated before the `login` function is called.\n\nPermanent_Fix: Implement a proper initialization of `auth_manager` at the application startup. This could involve creating an instance of the `AuthManager` class (or whatever class `auth_manager` is supposed to be) in a global context or within a dependency injection framework if using FastAPI. Ensure that this instance is available throughout the application lifecycle. Additionally, add unit tests to verify that `auth_manager` is correctly instantiated and accessible in the `login` function.\n\nPrevention: Introduce a code review process to ensure that all necessary variables and objects are defined and initialized before use. Implement automated tests that check for the presence of required dependencies in critical functions. Additionally, consider using static analysis tools that can catch undefined variables during development.\n\nRisk_Level: MEDIUM - The risk of implementing the solution is moderate as it involves modifying the application structure, which could lead to further issues if not done carefully.\n\nConfidence: HIGH - I am confident that defining and initializing `auth_manager` properly will resolve the immediate error and prevent similar issues in the future.\n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
