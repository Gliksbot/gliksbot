  "content": "# Proposal for Implementing Live Streaming Collaboration in Normal.jsx\n\n## Analysis\nThe request highlights the need to enhance the user interface of the Normal page by replacing static file counts with a live streaming output of LLM collaboration. The existing `ActivityStream` component, which utilizes Server-Sent Events (SSE) to stream live activity, is not currently integrated into the Normal page. The goal is to create a more dynamic and engaging experience for users by allowing them to view real-time collaboration instead of just a list of files.\n\n## Approach\n1. **Import the ActivityStream Component**: The first step is to import the `ActivityStream` component into the `Normal.jsx` file.\n2. **Create Tab Structure**: Introduce a tabbed interface that allows users to switch between the \"Live Stream\" and \"Files\" sections. This will provide a clear and organized layout for users to access both functionalities.\n3. **Replace Static File Section**: The static file count section will be replaced with the new tab structure, ensuring that the live stream is prominently displayed.\n4. **Ensure Proper JSX Structure**: Care must be taken to maintain the integrity of the JSX structure to avoid syntax errors and ensure that the application compiles correctly.\n5. **Testing**: After implementation, the changes will need to be tested to ensure that the live streaming functionality works as intended and that there are no regressions in the existing features.\n\n## Implementation\n### Step 1: Import ActivityStream\nAdd the following import statement at the top of `Normal.jsx`:\n```javascript\nimport ActivityStream from './ActivityStream';\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create Tab State\nAdd a new state to manage the tab selection:\n```javascript\nconst [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('liveStream');\n```\n\n### Step 3: Create Tab Structure\nReplace the existing collaboration files section with a tab structure:\n```javascript\n<div>\n  <div className=\"tabs\">\n    <button onClick={() => setActiveTab('liveStream')}>Live Stream</button>\n    <button onClick={() => setActiveTab('files')}>Files</button>\n  </div>\n  {activeTab === 'liveStream' && <ActivityStream />}\n  {activeTab === 'files' && <CollaborationFiles />}\n</div>\n```\n\n### Step 4: Replace Static Section\nFind the section where the static file counts are displayed and replace it with the above tab structure. Ensure that the JSX is properly formatted and closed.\n\n### Step 5: Testing\nAfter implementing the changes, run the application and verify that:\n- The `ActivityStream` component displays live collaboration data.\n- Users can switch between the \"Live Stream\" and \"Files\" tabs without issues.\n- No existing functionality is broken.\n\n### SKILL_SPEC\n**Skill Required**: React Component Integration\n- Understanding of React hooks (useState).\n- Familiarity with JSX structure and component rendering.\n- Knowledge of event handling in React.\n\nThis approach will ensure that the Normal page is enhanced with a live streaming feature, providing users with a more interactive experience while collaborating with LLMs."
