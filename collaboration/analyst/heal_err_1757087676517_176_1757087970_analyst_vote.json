  "content": "Analysis: The \"HEALING_TIMEOUT\" error indicates that the healing session for the original error (err_1757070558751_0) did not complete within the expected timeframe. This could be due to several factors, including high system load, insufficient resources allocated for the healing process, or potential deadlocks in the healing logic. The presence of 131 recent errors and 61 related 'HEALING_TIMEOUT' errors suggests a systemic issue that may be overwhelming the error handling mechanisms.\n\nImmediate_Action: \n1. Increase the timeout threshold for healing sessions temporarily to allow more time for completion.\n2. Monitor system load and resource utilization to identify any bottlenecks.\n3. Restart the error_healer service to clear any potential deadlocks or stuck processes.\n\nPermanent_Fix: \n1. Conduct a thorough review of the healing process logic to identify inefficiencies or potential deadlocks. \n2. Optimize the healing algorithm to ensure it can handle peak loads effectively.\n3. Implement a queuing mechanism for healing requests to prevent overwhelming the system during high error rates.\n4. Increase available resources (CPU, memory) for the error_healer service based on usage patterns.\n\nPrevention: \n1. Set up monitoring and alerts for healing session durations and system resource utilization to catch issues before they escalate.\n2. Implement logging for healing sessions to analyze patterns leading to timeouts.\n3. Regularly review and update the healing process based on historical error data to enhance resilience.\n\nRisk_Level: MEDIUM - While the immediate actions are low-risk, the permanent fix involves changes to the healing logic and resource allocation, which could impact system performance if not tested properly.\n\nConfidence: HIGH - The proposed solutions are based on common practices for handling similar timeout errors and optimizing system performance.\n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
