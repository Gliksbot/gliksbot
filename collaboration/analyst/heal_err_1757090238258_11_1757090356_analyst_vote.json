  "content": "Analysis: The error `NameError: name 'auth_manager' is not defined` indicates that the variable `auth_manager` is being referenced in the `login` function without being properly defined or imported. This suggests that either the `auth_manager` instance was not created, or it was not included in the scope of the function where it is being called.\n\nImmediate_Action: To mitigate the issue immediately, check the `login` function in `main.py` at line 337. Ensure that `auth_manager` is properly defined and instantiated before it is used. If it is defined in another module, ensure that it is imported correctly at the top of the file. If it is meant to be passed as a dependency, modify the function signature to accept it.\n\nPermanent_Fix: The long-term solution involves refactoring the code to ensure that `auth_manager` is always available in the scope where it is needed. This can be achieved by:\n1. Defining `auth_manager` at a higher scope (e.g., as a global variable or as part of a class).\n2. Using dependency injection to pass `auth_manager` to the `login` function if using a framework like FastAPI.\n3. Implementing proper error handling to catch and log such errors before they cause a failure.\n\nPrevention: To prevent similar errors in the future, implement the following:\n1. Code reviews to ensure that all dependencies are properly defined and imported.\n2. Unit tests for critical functions to ensure that they fail gracefully when dependencies are missing.\n3. Static code analysis tools that can detect undefined variables before runtime.\n\nRisk_Level: MEDIUM - The immediate action may require changes in the codebase that could affect other parts of the application if not handled carefully. However, it is necessary to resolve the current error.\n\nConfidence: HIGH - The proposed solutions are based on standard practices for resolving `NameError` issues in Python and should effectively address the underlying problem.\n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
