  "content": "Analysis: The error \"name 'auth_manager' is not defined\" indicates that the variable or object `auth_manager` is being referenced in the code without being properly initialized or imported. This typically occurs when the variable is either not declared in the current scope or is missing from the module that is supposed to provide it. The root cause could be due to a missing import statement, a typo in the variable name, or the `auth_manager` not being instantiated before its usage.\n\nImmediate_Action: To mitigate the issue immediately, check the following:\n1. Verify if `auth_manager` is defined in the current file or imported from another module.\n2. If it is supposed to be imported, ensure that the import statement is present at the beginning of the file.\n3. If `auth_manager` is a class or function that needs to be instantiated, ensure that it is properly initialized before the `login` function is called.\n\nPermanent_Fix: For a long-term solution:\n1. Ensure that `auth_manager` is defined and instantiated correctly in a global or appropriate scope before it is used in the `login` function.\n2. Consider implementing dependency injection to manage instances like `auth_manager`, which can help in reducing such errors.\n3. Add unit tests to cover the authentication functionality to catch such issues during development.\n\nPrevention: To prevent similar errors in the future:\n1. Implement static code analysis tools that can catch undefined variables and other common coding errors before deployment.\n2. Use type hinting and annotations to clarify the expected types and instances in the codebase.\n3. Establish a code review process where peers can check for such issues before merging changes.\n\nRisk_Level: MEDIUM - The risk of implementing these solutions is moderate, as they involve code changes that could impact the authentication flow if not tested properly.\n\nConfidence: HIGH - I am confident that addressing the undefined variable issue through proper definition and instantiation will resolve the immediate error and implementing the suggested long-term solutions will help prevent similar issues in the future.\n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
