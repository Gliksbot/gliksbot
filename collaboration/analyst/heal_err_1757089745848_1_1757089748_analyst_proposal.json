  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error message indicates a `NameError` for `auth_manager`, which suggests that the variable or object `auth_manager` is not defined in the scope where it is being called. This typically occurs when:\n- The variable has not been initialized or imported.\n- There is a typo in the variable name.\n- The variable is defined in a different module or file that has not been properly referenced.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Root Cause Identification**: \n   - Check the definition of `auth_manager` in the codebase. Ensure that it is properly instantiated and accessible within the scope of the `login` function in `main.py`.\n   - Verify that any necessary imports are included at the beginning of the file.\n\n2. **Immediate Action**: \n   - Locate the definition of `auth_manager`. If it exists, ensure it is correctly imported or instantiated before the `login` function is called. If it does not exist, create an instance of `auth_manager` or import it from the appropriate module.\n\n3. **Permanent Fix**: \n   - Refactor the code to ensure that `auth_manager` is always defined before it is used. This could involve initializing it in a global context or passing it as a dependency to the `login` function.\n\n4. **Prevention**: \n   - Implement unit tests that check for the existence of critical variables before their usage.\n   - Use static code analysis tools to catch undefined variables during development.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment**: \n   - The risk of implementing these changes is **MEDIUM**. While correcting the error is essential, there is a chance that changes to the scope or initialization of `auth_manager` could affect other parts of the application if not handled carefully.\n\n### Implementation\n1. **Immediate Steps**:\n   - Open `main.py` and locate the `login` function.\n   - Check for the definition of `auth_manager`. If it is missing, add the following line before its usage:\n     ```python\n     from your_module import AuthManager  # Adjust the import based on your project structure\n     auth_manager = AuthManager()  # Initialize the auth_manager\n     ```\n\n2. **Permanent Fix**:\n   - Consider refactoring the `login` function to accept `auth_manager` as a parameter:\n     ```python\n     async def login(credentials: Credentials, auth_manager: AuthManager):\n         user_info = auth_manager.authenticate_user(credentials.username, credentials.password)\n     ```\n   - Ensure that wherever `login` is called, `auth_manager` is passed as an argument.\n\n3. **Prevention**:\n   - Set up a linter (like flake8 or pylint) in your development environment to catch undefined variables.\n   - Write unit tests for the `login` function to ensure that it behaves correctly when `auth_manager` is not defined.\n\n### Summary\nBy addressing the immediate issue of the undefined `auth_manager`, implementing a permanent fix to ensure its availability, and setting up preventive measures, we can stabilize the application and enhance its resilience against similar errors in the future."
