==================================================
### Analysis
The user request is a simple inquiry asking if "Dexter" is currently working. This could imply a need for confirmation of availability or readiness to assist with a task. The context suggests that the user may be looking to initiate a collaboration or seek assistance from Dexter.

### Approach
To address the user's request effectively, we can implement a response system that confirms Dexter's availability. This could involve:

1. **Availability Check**: Establish a mechanism to determine if Dexter is currently active or engaged in another task.
2. **Response Generation**: Create a friendly and informative response to confirm availability.
3. **Next Steps**: If Dexter is available, offer to assist with any specific tasks or questions the user may have.

### Implementation
Since this request does not require a new skill but rather a straightforward response mechanism, we can outline the following steps for implementation:

1. **Availability Check Function**:
   - Create a function that checks Dexter's current status (active/inactive).
   
   ```python
   def check_availability():
       # Placeholder logic for checking availability
       return "active"  # or "inactive"
   ```

2. **Response Function**:
   - Generate a response based on the availability status.
   
   ```python
   def generate_response():
       status = check_availability()
       if status == "active":
           return "Hello! Yes, I'm here and ready to assist you."
       else:
           return "Hello! I'm currently unavailable, but I'll get back to you as soon as I can."
   ```

3. **Integration**:
   - Integrate the availability check and response generation into the user interaction flow.

By following this approach, we can ensure that the user receives a clear and prompt response regarding Dexter's availability, fostering effective communication and collaboration.
