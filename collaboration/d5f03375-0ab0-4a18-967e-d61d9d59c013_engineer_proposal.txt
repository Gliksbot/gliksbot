**Analysis:**

The user is asking for a question that only they would know the answer to. This implies a need for personalization and privacy, as the question should be unique and specific to the user's personal experiences, preferences, or knowledge. The challenge here is that as an AI, I do not have access to personal data or past interactions with the user, which makes it difficult to generate a truly personalized question.

**Approach:**

To address this request, we can guide the user through a process of self-reflection to generate a question themselves. This involves prompting the user to think about unique experiences, preferences, or knowledge areas that are specific to them. By doing so, the user can create a question that is personal and meaningful.

1. **Prompt for Reflection:** Encourage the user to think about specific areas of their life or interests that are unique to them. This could include memorable experiences, personal achievements, favorite hobbies, or unique skills.

2. **Guide Question Formation:** Provide a framework or examples to help the user formulate a question. This could involve suggesting categories or types of questions, such as "What was the most memorable moment in your last vacation?" or "What is a skill you have that few people know about?"

3. **Encourage Personalization:** Remind the user that the question should be something only they would know, ensuring it is specific and personal.

**Implementation:**

Here is a step-by-step guide to help the user create their own personalized question:

1. **Reflect on Unique Experiences:**
   - Think about a recent event or experience that was significant to you. What made it memorable?

2. **Consider Personal Interests:**
   - What is a hobby or interest that you are passionate about? Is there a specific aspect of it that you excel in?

3. **Identify Personal Achievements:**
   - Reflect on a personal achievement that you are proud of. What was the journey like to achieve it?

4. **Formulate the Question:**
   - Using the reflections above, create a question. For example:
     - "What was the most challenging part of my last project at work?"
     - "What is my favorite book and why does it resonate with me?"

By following this guide, the user can generate a question that is truly unique to them, fulfilling the request for a personalized question.
