  "content": "**Analysis**  \nThe error pattern `HEALING_TIMEOUT:error_healer` recurring 4 times in 10 minutes suggests that the system's error healing mechanism is timing out repeatedly. This indicates either:  \n1. The healing process is stuck in an infinite loop or deadlock.  \n2. The underlying issue being healed is too complex or resource-intensive for the current timeout threshold.  \n3. The error_healer service is under-resourced (CPU/memory) or experiencing high latency.  \n\nGiven that the source is `error_tracker`, this might relate to the system's self-monitoring and auto-remediation logic. The absence of a stack trace implies the error might be occurring at a system level rather than within application code.\n\n**Approach**  \n1. **Immediate Mitigation**: Temporarily increase the timeout threshold for the healing process to allow completion, while adding detailed logging to capture what happens during the healing attempt.  \n2. **Root Cause Investigation**: Inspect the healing logic for potential infinite loops or deadlocks, and profile resource usage during healing operations.  \n3. **Long-term Solution**: Refactor the healing process to be more asynchronous and resilient, possibly using a queue-based system with retries and exponential backoff.  \n4. **Prevention**: Implement better monitoring around healing processes, including timeouts, success rates, and resource consumption.  \n\n**Implementation**  \n```python\n# SKILL_SPEC: Error Healing System Optimization\n\n# 1. Increase timeout temporarily (config change)\n# In error_healer configuration:\nHEALING_TIMEOUT = 30000  # Increase from current value (e.g., 10000ms) to 30000ms\n\n# 2. Add detailed logging to healing process\ndef error_healer(error_id):\n    logger.info(f\"Healing started for error {error_id}\")\n    start_time = time.time()\n    \n    try:\n        # Existing healing logic\n        result = perform_healing(error_id)\n        \n        # Check if healing took too long\n        healing_time = time.time() - start_time\n        if healing_time > WARN_THRESHOLD:\n            logger.warning(f\"Healing for {error_id} took {healing_time:.2f}s\")\n            \n        return result\n    except TimeoutError:\n        logger.error(f\"Healing timeout for {error_id} after {time.time()-start_time:.2f}s\")\n        # Add specific timeout handling\n        raise\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Healing failed for {error_id}: {str(e)}\")\n        raise\n\n# 3. Implement async healing with retry logic\nasync def async_error_healer(error_id, max_retries=3):\n    for attempt in range(max_retries):\n        try:\n            result = await perform_async_healing(error_id)\n            return result\n        except Exception as e:\n            if attempt == max_retries - 1:\n                raise\n            await asyncio.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff\n\n# 4. Add monitoring metrics\nmetrics.track('healing_attempts', tags=['error_type'])\nmetrics.track('healing_duration', tags=['success'])\nmetrics.track('healing_timeouts', tags=['error_id'])\n```\n\n**Risk Assessment**  \n- **Risk_Level**: MEDIUM (temporary config changes are low risk, but architectural changes require careful testing)  \n- **Confidence**: HIGH (timeout issues typically respond well to increased thresholds + better logging)  \n\n**Immediate Action Steps**  \n1. Increase `HEALING_TIMEOUT` by 200% in configuration  \n2. Add detailed logging to capture healing process duration and steps  \n3. Monitor system resources during healing operations  \n4. Set up alert for healing timeouts exceeding new threshold  \n\nThis approach provides immediate relief while enabling proper diagnosis and permanent solution implementation."
