  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the required module, which is likely due to one of the following root causes:\n- The module is not installed in the current environment.\n- The module exists but is not on the Python path.\n- There is a version mismatch or a broken installation.\n- The module name has been changed or the import statement is incorrect.\n\nGiven the critical severity and the fact that this is a startup error, the immediate priority is to restore system functionality by ensuring the module is available.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing module if it exists in a repository, or check the system path.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure dependency management is robust, using a virtual environment and a requirements file to track and install dependencies.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks during deployment or startup to validate all dependencies are met before proceeding.\n\n### Implementation\n\n#### Immediate_Action:\n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is installed by running:  \n   `pip list | grep dexter_brain` (Unix) or `pip list | findstr dexter_brain` (Windows).  \n   If not found, install it via pip if it's available on PyPI or a private index:  \n   `pip install dexter_brain`  \n   If it's a local module, ensure it is in the Python path or install it in development mode:  \n   `pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain`  \n\n2. If the module is installed but not found, check the Python path:  \n   `import sys; print(sys.path)`  \n   Ensure the module's parent directory is included.\n\n3. Restart the application after resolving the dependency.\n\n#### Permanent_Fix:\n1. Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n2. Maintain a `requirements.txt` file with all dependencies, including `dexter_brain`.\n3. Automate dependency installation during deployment using:  \n   `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n\n#### Prevention:\n1. Add a pre-startup check script that validates all required modules are installed.\n2. Implement continuous integration (CI) checks to ensure dependencies are correctly specified and tested before deployment.\n3. Use logging or alerts for missing dependencies during startup.\n\n#### Risk_Level: LOW  \nThe solution involves standard dependency management practices with minimal risk.\n\n#### Confidence: HIGH  \nThis is a common issue with well-established solutions in Python environments."
