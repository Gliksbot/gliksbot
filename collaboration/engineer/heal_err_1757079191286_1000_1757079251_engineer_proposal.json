  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `HEALING_TIMEOUT` indicates that the `error_healer` subsystem itself is failing to complete a healing session within the expected timeframe. This is a meta-error where the error recovery mechanism is timing out while attempting to heal another error (`err_1757078980242_56`). Root causes likely include:\n- **Resource exhaustion**: The healing process may be consuming excessive CPU, memory, or I/O, causing it to stall.\n- **Deadlock or infinite loop**: The healing logic for the original error might have entered an unrecoverable state.\n- **Overloaded system**: High system load (1000 recent errors) may be preventing timely execution of healing routines.\n- **Complex error scenario**: The original error might require a healing process that is inherently long-running or has complex dependencies.\n\nGiven that the source is `error_healer`, this points to a flaw in the error recovery infrastructure rather than the application logic itself.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate mitigation**: Temporarily bypass the healing mechanism for the problematic error to prevent cascading timeouts.\n2. **Investigate the original error**: Determine if `err_1757078980242_56` is causing the healing process to hang.\n3. **Add safeguards**: Implement timeouts and circuit breakers within the healing system to prevent it from becoming a single point of failure.\n4. **Optimize healing logic**: Review the healing routines for performance bottlenecks and potential deadlocks.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate Action**:\n```python\n# In error_healer service, skip healing for the specific error ID temporarily\ndef handle_error(error_id):\n    if error_id == \"err_1757078980242_56\":\n        logger.warning(f\"Skipping healing for {error_id} due to timeout issues\")\n        return {\"status\": \"skipped\", \"reason\": \"healing_timeout\"}\n    # ... proceed with normal healing logic\n```\n\n**Permanent Fix**:\n```python\n# Add timeout decorator to healing functions\nimport signal\nfrom functools import wraps\n\nclass TimeoutException(Exception):\n    pass\n\ndef timeout(seconds=30):\n    def decorator(func):\n        @wraps(func)\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            def signal_handler(signum, frame):\n                raise TimeoutException(\"Function timed out\")\n            \n            signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, signal_handler)\n            signal.alarm(seconds)\n            try:\n                result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n            finally:\n                signal.alarm(0)\n            return result\n        return wrapper\n    return decorator\n\n# Apply to healing functions\n@timeout(seconds=25)  # Less than the system timeout\ndef heal_error(error_id):\n    # Healing logic here\n```\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Add monitoring for healing process duration with alerts for near-timeout scenarios\n- Implement a circuit breaker pattern to disable healing for specific error types after repeated failures\n- Add resource usage tracking to prevent healing processes from consuming excessive resources\n\n**Risk_Level**: MEDIUM (temporarily skipping healing for one error type)\n**Confidence**: HIGH (timeout implementation is a proven pattern for preventing hanging processes)"
