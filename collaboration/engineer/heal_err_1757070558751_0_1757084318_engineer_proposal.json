  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`, specifically when attempting to import `create_sandbox` from `dexter_brain.sandbox` during system startup. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package in the current environment. The root cause is likely one of the following:\n- The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the environment.\n- The package is installed but not on the Python path (e.g., incorrect virtual environment, missing `__init__.py`, or misconfigured `PYTHONPATH`).\n- There is a version mismatch or a broken installation.\n- The codebase structure has changed, and the module path is incorrect.\n\nGiven the critical severity and startup context, this is likely a deployment or environment configuration issue rather than a code logic error.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Verify Environment**: Check if the `dexter_brain` package is installed and accessible.\n2. **Path Configuration**: Ensure the module is on the Python path, especially if it's a local package (not installed via pip).\n3. **Dependency Management**: Validate that all dependencies are correctly defined and installed (e.g., in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`).\n4. **Fallback Mechanism**: Implement a graceful fallback or retry mechanism for critical startup dependencies to avoid complete failure.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate Action**:\n1. Check the current environment:\n   ```bash\n   pip list | grep dexter_brain\n   ```\n   If not found, install it:\n   ```bash\n   pip install dexter_brain  # or use a specific version if needed\n   ```\n   If it's a local package, ensure it's installed in editable mode:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain\n   ```\n2. Verify the Python path:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   print(sys.path)\n   ```\n   Ensure the directory containing `dexter_brain` is included.\n3. If the package is missing entirely, check the project structure. If `dexter_brain` is supposed to be a subdirectory, ensure it exists and has an `__init__.py` file.\n\n**Permanent Fix**:\n- Formalize dependencies in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` and use a virtual environment.\n- Use a dependency management tool (e.g., `pipenv`, `poetry`) to ensure consistent environments.\n- In `main.py`, add error handling for imports during startup:\n   ```python\n   try:\n       from dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox\n   except ModuleNotFoundError as e:\n       logging.critical(f\"Critical dependency missing: {e}\")\n       # Attempt to install automatically? Only if safe and appropriate.\n       # Alternatively, exit gracefully with instructions.\n       sys.exit(1)\n   ```\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Use CI/CD pipelines to test environment setup and dependencies before deployment.\n- Implement health checks and monitoring for missing dependencies at startup.\n- Document environment setup procedures clearly.\n\n**Risk Level**: LOW (verifying and installing dependencies is low-risk if done correctly).\n**Confidence**: HIGH (this is a common issue with straightforward solutions)."
