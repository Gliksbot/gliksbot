  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` is a critical startup failure indicating that the Python module `dexter_brain` is missing from the environment where the application is running. This typically occurs due to:\n- The module not being installed in the current Python environment.\n- The module not being included in the project dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`).\n- A mismatch between the environment where the code was developed and where it is deployed.\n- The module might be part of a private or internal package that hasn't been properly distributed or installed.\n\nGiven the stack trace points to `line 120` in `main.py` during a startup event, this is likely a deployment or environment configuration issue rather than a code logic error.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Mitigation**: Verify the environment and install the missing module if it exists in a repository.\n2. **Root Cause Resolution**: Ensure the module is properly defined as a dependency and that the deployment process includes dependency installation.\n3. **Long-term Prevention**: Implement checks in the CI/CD pipeline to validate dependencies before deployment and use virtual environments to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Implementation\n\n#### Immediate_Action\n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is available in a package repository (e.g., PyPI or a private repo):\n   ```bash\n   pip search dexter_brain\n   ```\n   If it is found, install it:\n   ```bash\n   pip install dexter_brain\n   ```\n2. If it is not available publicly, check if it is a local module. Look for a `dexter_brain` directory in the project or a referenced path. If found, ensure it is in the Python path or install it in development mode:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain\n   ```\n3. Restart the application to see if the error resolves.\n\n#### Permanent_Fix\n1. Add `dexter_brain` to the project's `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` if it is an external package. For example, in `requirements.txt`:\n   ```\n   dexter_brain==1.0.0  # or appropriate version\n   ```\n2. If it is a local module, ensure it is packaged properly and included in the deployment bundle, or consider distributing it as a private package.\n3. Use a virtual environment for the project to isolate dependencies and ensure consistency across environments.\n\n#### Prevention\n1. Implement a pre-deployment validation step in the CI/CD pipeline to check for all required dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt && python -c \"import dexter_brain; print('dexter_brain available')\"\n   ```\n2. Use tools like `pip check` to verify dependency consistency.\n3. Document all dependencies and ensure the deployment process explicitly installs them.\n\n#### Risk_Level\n**LOW**: The solutions involve standard dependency management practices and do not modify application logic. The main risk is if the module is not available in any repository, which would require developing or sourcing it.\n\n#### Confidence\n**HIGH**: This is a common issue with well-established solutions in Python dependency management.\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (if needed)\nNo new skill is required beyond standard Python dependency management and deployment procedures."
