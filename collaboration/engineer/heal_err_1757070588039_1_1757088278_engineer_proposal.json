  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module when attempting to import it in `main.py` at line 120. This is a common issue in Python applications and typically stems from one of the following root causes:\n1. The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the current Python environment.\n2. The package is installed but not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect virtual environment, wrong PYTHONPATH).\n3. The package exists but has a naming inconsistency (e.g., case sensitivity, typo in import statement).\n4. The package is part of the project but not properly packaged or installed in development mode.\n\nGiven the context (startup error, critical severity, and no prior context), the most likely cause is that the `dexter_brain` package is missing from the environment where the application is running. This could be due to a recent deployment, environment misconfiguration, or dependency management oversight.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing package if it exists in a repository (e.g., PyPI, private index, or local wheel). If it's a local package, ensure it is installed in development mode or added to the path.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Improve dependency management and environment setup to ensure all required packages are explicitly defined and automatically installed during deployment/startup.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks during CI/CD or startup to validate all dependencies are available before running the application. Use tools like `pip check` or custom import validation scripts.\n4. **Risk Assessment**: The proposed solution is low-risk as it involves standard dependency management practices. However, care must be taken to avoid version conflicts or breaking changes.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate Action Steps**:\n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is listed in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`. If not, add it and ensure it is installed.\n2. Run `pip install dexter_brain` if it is a public package. If it is a local package, navigate to its directory and run `pip install -e .` (for development mode) or `pip install /path/to/dexter_brain`.\n3. Verify the installation by running `python -c \"import dexter_brain\"` in the same environment.\n4. Restart the application.\n\n**Permanent Fix**:\n- Use a virtual environment and explicitly define all dependencies in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`.\n- Automate dependency installation during deployment using:\n  ```bash\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  ```\n- For local packages, ensure they are installed in development mode or properly packaged and distributed.\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Add a pre-startup check script that attempts to import all critical modules and logs any missing dependencies.\n- Integrate dependency checks in CI/CD pipelines:\n  ```bash\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  pip check  # Verify no conflicts\n  python -m pytest tests/test_dependencies.py  # Custom tests for critical imports\n  ```\n- Use tools like `importlib` to validate imports programmatically at runtime if necessary.\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH\n\nThis solution is straightforward, minimally invasive, and addresses the core issue without disrupting ongoing operations."
