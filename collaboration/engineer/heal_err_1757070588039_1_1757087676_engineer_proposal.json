  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during the startup of the application. This typically occurs due to one of the following reasons:\n- The module is not installed in the current Python environment.\n- The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect directory structure or missing `__init__.py` files).\n- There is a version mismatch or dependency issue.\n- The module was renamed, moved, or deleted.\n\nGiven the stack trace points to `line 120` in `main.py` attempting to import from `dexter_brain.sandbox`, it is likely that the `dexter_brain` package is either missing from the environment or improperly configured.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Verify Environment and Dependencies**: Check if the `dexter_brain` module is listed in the project's dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`) and ensure it is installed.\n2. **Check Python Path and Module Structure**: Ensure the module directory structure is correct and accessible.\n3. **Implement Fallback or Diagnostic Measures**: If the module is critical, consider adding checks during startup to validate its presence and provide meaningful error messages.\n4. **Automate Dependency Management**: Use virtual environments and dependency management tools to avoid environment-related issues.\n\n### Implementation\n#### Immediate Action:\n1. **Check Installation**: Run `pip list | grep dexter_brain` (or `pip freeze | findstr dexter_brain` on Windows) to verify if the module is installed. If not, install it using `pip install dexter_brain` (if available on PyPI) or from the source.\n2. **Validate Python Path**: Ensure the module's parent directory is in `sys.path`. You can temporarily add it in code:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   sys.path.append('/path/to/dexter_brain_parent_directory')\n   ```\n3. **Restart Application**: After ensuring the module is available, restart the application.\n\n#### Permanent Fix:\n1. **Update Dependencies**: Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` or equivalent dependency file.\n2. **Use Virtual Environment**: Ensure the application runs in a virtual environment with all dependencies explicitly defined.\n3. **Add Startup Checks**: Implement a pre-startup check to validate critical modules:\n   ```python\n   try:\n       import dexter_brain\n   except ModuleNotFoundError:\n       logging.critical(\"dexter_brain module not found. Please install it.\")\n       sys.exit(1)\n   ```\n\n#### Prevention:\n- **Dependency Automation**: Use tools like `pip-tools` or `poetry` to manage dependencies and environments.\n- **CI/CD Checks**: Include dependency validation in CI/CD pipelines to catch missing modules early.\n- **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for `ModuleNotFoundError` exceptions during startup.\n\n#### Risk Assessment:\n- **Risk_Level**: LOW (adding dependency checks and ensuring module installation is low risk).\n- **Confidence**: HIGH (this is a common issue with straightforward solutions).\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (if needed)\nNo new skills required; standard Python dependency management and error handling practices apply.\n\n### Collaboration Note\nThis solution focuses on environment and dependency resolution, which is the most likely root cause. If the module is internal, ensure it is properly packaged and distributed."
