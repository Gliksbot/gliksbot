  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`, specifically when attempting to import `create_sandbox` from `dexter_brain.sandbox` during system startup. This indicates that the required Python package `dexter_brain` is either not installed, not installed in the correct environment, or the module path is incorrect. Given the context, it's likely that the package is missing from the environment where the application is running, possibly due to a deployment or dependency management issue.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Install the missing package or verify the environment setup.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure dependency management is robust, using a virtual environment and a requirements file.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks during deployment to validate all dependencies are present.\n4. **Risk Assessment**: The solution is low risk as it involves standard dependency management practices.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate Action**:\nRun the following command in the environment where the application is hosted (e.g., the backend directory):\n```bash\npip install dexter_brain\n```\nIf the package is not available on PyPI, you may need to install it from a source repository or a local wheel file. For example:\n```bash\npip install git+https://github.com/your_org/dexter_brain.git\n```\nOr if it's a local package:\n```bash\npip install /path/to/dexter_brain\n```\n\n**Permanent Fix**:\n1. Create a `requirements.txt` file (if not already present) listing all dependencies, including `dexter_brain`.\n2. Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies. For example:\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n3. Ensure the deployment process activates the virtual environment and installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`.\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Add a pre-startup check in `main.py` to validate that all required modules are importable. For example:\n  ```python\n  def check_dependencies():\n      required_modules = ['dexter_brain']\n      for module in required_modules:\n          try:\n              __import__(module)\n          except ImportError:\n              raise RuntimeError(f\"Missing required module: {module}\")\n  ```\n  Call this function before attempting to import other modules.\n- Integrate dependency checks into your CI/CD pipeline to catch missing dependencies before deployment.\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH\n\nThis approach addresses the root cause directly with minimal disruption and standard practices."
