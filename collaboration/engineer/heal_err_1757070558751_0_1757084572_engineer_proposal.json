  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module when attempting to import it in `main.py` at line 120. This is a common issue in Python applications and typically arises due to one of the following root causes:\n1. The module is not installed in the current Python environment.\n2. The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect directory structure or missing __init__.py files).\n3. The module name has a typo or has been renamed/moved.\n4. The environment (virtual environment, system PATH) is misconfigured.\n\nGiven the context (\"No context available\") and the fact that this is a startup error, it is likely that the deployment or setup process for the application is incomplete or incorrect. The `dexter_brain` module appears to be a custom/internal module, as it is not a standard Python library.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Check the environment and directory structure to confirm the presence of `dexter_brain`. If missing, install or restore it from source control.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure the module is properly packaged and installed, or adjust the Python path to include its location.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks in the startup script to validate all required modules before attempting to import them. Use dependency management tools (e.g., pip, poetry) to track and install dependencies.\n4. **Risk Assessment**: The fixes are low-risk as they involve environment configuration and code changes that do not affect business logic.\n\n### Implementation\n#### Immediate_Action:\n1. **Verify the module exists**: \n   - Navigate to the project directory: `cd M:\\gliksbot\\backend`\n   - Check if `dexter_brain` is present: `ls dexter_brain` (or `dir dexter_brain` on Windows). If it is missing, restore it from version control (e.g., `git checkout dexter_brain` if using Git).\n2. **Check Python path**:\n   - Temporarily add the current directory to Python path if needed. In `main.py`, before line 120, add:\n     ```python\n     import sys\n     sys.path.append('M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\backend')\n     ```\n   - This is a temporary workaround to allow the application to start.\n3. **Restart the application**: After making changes, restart the service to see if the error resolves.\n\n#### Permanent_Fix:\n1. **Package the module properly**:\n   - Ensure `dexter_brain` has an `__init__.py` file (even if empty) to mark it as a Python package.\n   - If `dexter_brain` is a separate package, install it in the environment using `pip install -e .` (if it has a setup.py) or move it to a directory in the Python path.\n2. **Use absolute imports**: Adjust the import in `main.py` to use an absolute path relative to the project root, e.g., `from backend.dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox` (if the project structure supports it).\n3. **Set PYTHONPATH**: Permanently add the project root to the environment variable `PYTHONPATH`. For example, in the startup script or system settings, set:\n   - `export PYTHONPATH=M:\\gliksbot:$PYTHONPATH` (Linux/macOS)\n   - `set PYTHONPATH=M:\\gliksbot;%PYTHONPATH%` (Windows)\n\n#### Prevention:\n1. **Add pre-startup checks**: In `main.py`, before importing any custom modules, add a check to validate that the module exists:\n   ```python\n   import importlib.util\n   def module_exists(module_name):\n       spec = importlib.util.find_spec(module_name)\n       return spec is not None\n\n   if not module_exists('dexter_brain'):\n       raise Exception(\"Critical dependency missing: dexter_brain\")\n   ```\n2. **Use requirements.txt or pyproject.toml**: List all dependencies (including internal packages) in a requirements file and ensure they are installed during deployment.\n3. **CI/CD checks**: In your deployment pipeline, add a step to verify all imports before starting the application.\n\n#### Risk_Level: LOW\nThe changes are confined to environment configuration and import statements, with no impact on core functionality.\n\n#### Confidence: HIGH\nThis is a standard Python module resolution issue with well-established solutions."
