  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during the import process in `main.py`. This is a common issue in Python applications and typically arises due to one of the following root causes:\n1. The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the current Python environment.\n2. The package is installed but not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect virtual environment, wrong PYTHONPATH).\n3. The module exists but has naming inconsistencies (case sensitivity, typos).\n4. The application is running from a different directory than expected, altering the import resolution.\n\nGiven the stack trace points to `startup_event` in `main.py`, this is likely an environment or dependency setup issue rather than a code logic error.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install missing dependencies.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure dependency management through a requirements.txt or Pipfile and use virtual environments.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement CI/CD checks for dependency installation and add import guards or checks in critical startup code.\n4. **Risk Assessment**: The proposed solution is low-risk as it involves standard dependency management practices.\n\n### Implementation\n\n#### Immediate_Action:\n1. Check if the `dexter_brain` module is installed:\n   ```bash\n   pip list | grep dexter-brain  # or use `pip show dexter_brain`\n   ```\n2. If not installed, install it immediately. If it's a local module, ensure it's in the Python path:\n   ```bash\n   pip install dexter_brain   # if available on PyPI\n   # OR for local development\n   pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain   # if it's a local package\n   ```\n3. Alternatively, add the module path to PYTHONPATH temporarily:\n   ```bash\n   export PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/dexter_brain\"\n   ```\n4. Restart the application.\n\n#### Permanent_Fix:\n1. Create a `requirements.txt` file (if not exists) and include `dexter_brain` or its source.\n2. Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n3. If `dexter_brain` is a local module, package it properly with `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` and install it in editable mode.\n\n#### Prevention:\n1. Add a dependency check at startup:\n   ```python\n   try:\n       import dexter_brain\n   except ModuleNotFoundError:\n       logging.critical(\"Dependency missing: dexter_brain. Please install it.\")\n       sys.exit(1)\n   ```\n2. Use CI/CD pipelines to run `pip install` and verify all imports before deployment.\n3. Monitor system logs for `ModuleNotFoundError` and set up alerts.\n\n#### Risk_Level: LOW\nThe solution involves standard Python dependency management practices and poses minimal risk.\n\n#### Confidence: HIGH\nThis is a well-understood issue with straightforward solutions."
