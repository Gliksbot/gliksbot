  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during the import process in `main.py`. This is a common issue in Python applications and typically stems from one of the following root causes:\n1. The module is not installed in the current Python environment.\n2. The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect directory structure or missing `__init__.py`).\n3. The module name is misspelled or has been renamed.\n4. The environment (virtual environment, system PATH) is misconfigured.\n\nGiven the context (startup error, critical severity, and no prior context), the most likely cause is that the `dexter_brain` package is either not installed or not properly packaged/distributed within the project. The stack trace points to a specific file (`M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\main.py`), suggesting a Windows environment where path issues or dependency management might be involved.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the presence of `dexter_brain` in the environment and attempt a reinstall or path adjustment.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure the dependency is explicitly declared (e.g., in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`) and that the project structure supports module discovery.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement dependency checks during startup or in CI/CD pipelines to catch missing modules early.\n4. **Risk Assessment**: The proposed solutions are low-risk as they involve dependency management and path checks, which are non-destructive and reversible.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate_Action**:  \n- Check if `dexter_brain` is installed by running `pip list | findstr dexter_brain` (Windows) or `pip freeze | grep dexter_brain` (Unix). If not found, install it via `pip install dexter_brain` (if it is a public package) or `pip install -e /path/to/local/dexter_brain` (if it is a local module).  \n- If the module is local, ensure the directory containing `dexter_brain` is in the Python path. You can temporarily modify `sys.path` in `main.py` before the import:  \n  ```python\n  import sys\n  sys.path.insert(0, 'M:/gliksbot/backend')  # Adjust path as needed\n  from dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox\n  ```\n- Restart the application.\n\n**Permanent_Fix**:  \n- Declare `dexter_brain` as a dependency in `requirements.txt` (if it is installable via pip) or use a `setup.py`/`pyproject.toml` if it is part of the project. For example, in `requirements.txt`:  \n  ```\n  dexter_brain>=1.0.0  # or use a local path: file:///M:/gliksbot/dexter_brain\n  ```\n- If `dexter_brain` is a local module, ensure it has a proper `__init__.py` and is structured as a package. The project layout should be:  \n  ```\n  backend/\n    main.py\n    dexter_brain/\n        __init__.py\n        sandbox.py\n  ```\n- Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies and avoid system-wide conflicts.\n\n**Prevention**:  \n- Add a pre-startup check in `main.py` to validate critical dependencies:  \n  ```python\n  try:\n      import dexter_brain\n  except ModuleNotFoundError:\n      logging.critical(\"Missing dependency: dexter_brain\")\n      sys.exit(1)\n  ```\n- Integrate dependency checks into CI/CD pipelines (e.g., run `pip check` or attempt imports in test scripts).\n- Use tools like `pip-tools` or `poetry` for robust dependency management.\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH"
