  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package during the import in `main.py`. The root cause is likely one of the following:\n- The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the current Python environment.\n- The package is installed but in a different environment or path than the one being used.\n- There is a typo or incorrect naming in the import statement or the package itself.\n- The package may be part of a local development setup that hasn't been properly deployed or linked.\n\nGiven the context of a startup error in a backend system, it's probable that the deployment or environment setup is incomplete or misconfigured.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Verify Environment**: Check if the Python environment has the `dexter_brain` package installed.\n2. **Install Missing Package**: If missing, install it using the appropriate method (e.g., pip, from source).\n3. **Validate Paths**: Ensure the Python path includes the directory where `dexter_brain` is located.\n4. **Check for Typos**: Confirm the correctness of the import statement and the package name.\n5. **Automate Dependency Management**: Use a requirements.txt or similar to manage dependencies systematically.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate Action**:\nRun the following commands in the backend directory to check and install the missing package:\n```bash\n# Check if dexter_brain is installed\npip list | grep dexter_brain\n\n# If not found, install it (assuming it's available via pip or a repository)\npip install dexter_brain\n\n# If it's a local package, install it from the source\npip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain\n```\n\n**Permanent Fix**:\n1. Add `dexter_brain` to a `requirements.txt` file in the project root:\n   ```txt\n   dexter_brain==1.0.0  # or appropriate version\n   ```\n2. Ensure the deployment script or CI/CD pipeline installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Use virtual environments to isolate project dependencies.\n- Implement dependency checks in the startup script or CI/CD pipeline to validate all required packages are installed before running.\n- Add logging or health checks that verify critical modules are importable during initialization.\n\n**Risk Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH"
