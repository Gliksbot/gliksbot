This is a common text processing task that involves reading a file, splitting its content into words, and counting them. The solution should handle basic edge cases like punctuation and multiple spaces. The script should be simple, efficient, and easy to use.\n\n**Approach**\nI'll write a Python script that:\n1. Takes a file path as input (via command-line argument or user input)\n2. Reads the file content\n3. Splits the text into words using whitespace as delimiter\n4. Counts the words\n5. Outputs the result\n\nThe script will handle:\n- Multiple spaces between words\n- Punctuation (though simple splitting may count \"word.\" as one word)\n- Empty files\n- File not found errors\n\n**Implementation**\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport string\n\ndef count_words(file_path):\n    try:\n        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:\n            content = file.read()\n            \n        # Remove punctuation and split into words\n        translator = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)\n        cleaned_content = content.translate(translator)\n        \n        words = cleaned_content.split()\n        return len(words)\n        \n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"Error: File '{file_path}' not found.\")\n        return 0\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error reading file: {e}\")\n        return 0\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    if len(sys.argv) != 2:\n        print(\"Usage: python wordcount.py <file_path>\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n    \n    file_path = sys.argv[1]\n    word_count = count_words(file_path)\n    print(f\"Word count: {word_count}\")\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n```bash\npython wordcount.py sample.txt\n```\n\nThe script handles punctuation by removing it before splitting, provides error handling for common file issues, and gives clear output. For more advanced word counting (handling contractions, hyphenated words, etc.), additional processing would be needed."
