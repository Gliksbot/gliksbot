  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the `dexter_brain` module during system startup. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the required module, which is critical for initializing the system. The root cause is likely one of the following:\n- The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the current Python environment.\n- The module is installed but not on the Python path (e.g., incorrect virtual environment, missing `__init__.py`, or misconfigured package structure).\n- There might be a version mismatch or a broken installation.\n- The codebase might have been moved or the dependencies were not properly set up.\n\nGiven the severity (CRITICAL) and the context (startup failure), this is a blocking issue that prevents the system from running.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing module if it exists in the project's dependency management (e.g., `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`). If not, check the source code structure.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure the module is properly packaged and included in the dependency list, and that the environment is consistently set up using a virtual environment or containerization.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks during CI/CD to validate all dependencies are present before deployment, and use robust dependency management tools.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate_Action**:\n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is listed in `requirements.txt` or similar. If yes, run:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n2. If not, check the project structure. If `dexter_brain` is a local package, ensure it is in the correct directory (e.g., same level as `main.py` or in a `src/` folder) and has an `__init__.py` file.\n3. Alternatively, install it directly if it's available on a package index:\n   ```bash\n   pip install dexter-brain\n   ```\n   (Note: The module name might use hyphens in the package name.)\n\n**Permanent_Fix**:\n1. Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` with the correct version.\n2. Use a virtual environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`) to isolate dependencies. Example:\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n3. Consider using Docker to containerize the application for consistent environments.\n\n**Prevention**:\n1. Add a pre-startup check in `main.py` to validate critical imports:\n   ```python\n   try:\n       import dexter_brain\n   except ModuleNotFoundError as e:\n       logging.critical(f\"Missing critical dependency: {e}\")\n       sys.exit(1)\n   ```\n2. Integrate dependency checks in CI/CD pipelines (e.g., run `pip check` or test imports in a build step).\n3. Use tools like `pipenv` or `poetry` for better dependency management.\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW (dependency installation and environment fixes are standard and low-risk).  \n**Confidence**: HIGH (common issue with straightforward solutions).\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (if needed)\nNo new skill required; this is a standard Python dependency issue."
