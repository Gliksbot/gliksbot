  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `HEALING_TIMEOUT:error_healer` recurring three times in 10 minutes suggests that the system's error healing mechanism is timing out during its execution. Given that the source is `error_tracker`, this likely indicates that the error healing process itself is failing to complete within its allotted time, possibly due to resource constraints, inefficient healing logic, or a high volume of errors overwhelming the system. The absence of a stack trace implies that the timeout might be occurring at a system or infrastructure level rather than within application code. The high number of recent errors (126) and critical errors (2) further suggests system instability or resource exhaustion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Mitigation**: Temporarily increase the timeout threshold for the healing process to allow completion, while monitoring system resources to avoid further degradation.\n2. **Root Cause Investigation**: Analyze the `error_healer` module for performance bottlenecks, review recent changes, and check system metrics (CPU, memory, I/O) during error spikes.\n3. **Long-Term Solution**: Optimize the healing logic, implement better error queuing and processing, and add circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures.\n4. **Prevention**: Enhance monitoring with alerts for healing timeouts and error rates, and implement automated scaling for the error tracker under load.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate Action**:\n- Increase the `HEALING_TIMEOUT` value in the error tracker configuration (e.g., from 30s to 60s) to provide more time for healing processes.\n- Restart the error tracker service to clear any stuck processes.\n- Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) to identify if resource exhaustion is contributing.\n\n**Permanent Fix**:\n- Refactor the `error_healer` to use asynchronous processing and batch operations for efficiency.\n- Implement a priority queue for errors, ensuring critical errors are handled first.\n- Add logging within the healing process to capture detailed timing and identify slow steps.\n- Example code snippet for async batch processing (pseudo-code):\n```python\nasync def heal_errors_batch(error_ids):\n    batch_size = 10\n    for i in range(0, len(error_ids), batch_size):\n        batch = error_ids[i:i+batch_size]\n        await asyncio.gather(*[heal_single_error(err_id) for err_id in batch])\n```\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Set up alerts for `HEALING_TIMEOUT` occurrences and error rate spikes.\n- Implement auto-scaling for the error tracker service based on error queue length.\n- Regularly review and optimize healing logic as part of maintenance.\n\n**Risk_Level**: MEDIUM (temporary config changes are low risk, but refactoring requires testing)\n**Confidence**: HIGH (timeout adjustments and optimization are standard practices for such issues)"
