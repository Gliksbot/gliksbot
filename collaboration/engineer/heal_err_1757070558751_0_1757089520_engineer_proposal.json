  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`, specifically when attempting to import `create_sandbox` from `dexter_brain.sandbox` during system startup. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package in the current environment. The root cause is likely one of the following:\n- The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the environment.\n- The package is installed but not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect virtual environment, misconfigured PYTHONPATH).\n- The package exists but is corrupted or incomplete.\n- There is a version mismatch or dependency issue.\n\nGiven the context (startup error, no prior context available), the most probable cause is a missing installation of the `dexter_brain` package, possibly due to a deployment or environment setup issue.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing package if it exists in a repository.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure the package is properly included in dependency management (e.g., requirements.txt, setup.py) and automate environment validation during deployment.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement pre-startup checks for critical dependencies and use CI/CD pipelines to validate environments before deployment.\n\n### Implementation\n#### Immediate_Action:\n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is available in your package repository (e.g., PyPI, private repo). If it is, install it immediately:\n   ```bash\n   pip install dexter_brain\n   ```\n   If it's a private package, ensure you have the correct repository configured and credentials set.\n\n2. If the package is not in a repository but exists locally or in version control, install it from source:\n   ```bash\n   pip install /path/to/dexter_brain\n   ```\n   Or, if it's in a Git repository:\n   ```bash\n   pip install git+https://github.com/yourorg/dexter_brain.git\n   ```\n\n3. Restart the application after installation.\n\n#### Permanent_Fix:\n1. Add `dexter_brain` to your project's dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`).\n2. Use a virtual environment and ensure all dependencies are installed during deployment via:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n3. Consider using a tool like `pip freeze` to pin versions and avoid conflicts.\n\n#### Prevention:\n1. Add a pre-startup validation script that checks for critical modules:\n   ```python\n   # pre_start_check.py\n   required_modules = ['dexter_brain']\n   for module in required_modules:\n       try:\n           __import__(module)\n       except ImportError:\n           raise SystemExit(f\"CRITICAL: Missing module {module}. Aborting startup.\")\n   ```\n   Run this script before starting the main application.\n\n2. Integrate dependency checks into your CI/CD pipeline to fail builds if required packages are missing.\n\n#### Risk_Level: LOW\n- Installing a missing package is low risk if the package is stable and correctly versioned.\n- Pre-startup checks add minimal overhead and prevent startup failures.\n\n#### Confidence: HIGH\n- This is a common issue with straightforward solutions. The steps are standard for Python dependency management.\n\n### Collaboration Note:\nIf the `dexter_brain` package is custom/internal, ensure the team has access to it and it is properly packaged. If it does not exist, this may indicate a larger development or deployment issue that requires collaboration with the team responsible for that module."
