  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during the import process in `main.py`. This is a common issue in Python applications and typically arises due to one of the following root causes:\n- The module is not installed in the current Python environment.\n- The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect directory structure or missing __init__.py files).\n- There might be a version mismatch or a broken installation.\n- The module name could have been changed or refactored without updating the import statements.\n\nGiven the context that this is a startup error and part of a larger system with multiple recent errors, it is likely that the deployment or environment setup is inconsistent or incomplete.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Mitigation**: Verify the environment and dependencies. Reinstall or ensure the module is correctly placed.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Standardize the environment setup using dependency management tools and ensure consistent deployment practices.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks in CI/CD pipelines to validate module availability and use static analysis tools to catch import errors early.\n\n### Implementation\n\n#### Immediate_Action\n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is installed:\n   ```bash\n   pip list | grep dexter_brain\n   ```\n   If not found, install it:\n   ```bash\n   pip install dexter_brain  # If it's a public package\n   ```\n   Or, if it's a local module, ensure the directory containing `dexter_brain` is in the Python path. You can temporarily modify the path in `main.py`:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   sys.path.append('/path/to/dexter_brain_parent_directory')\n   from dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox\n   ```\n2. Verify the directory structure: Ensure `dexter_brain` is a package (contains `__init__.py`) and is located in a directory accessible by the Python process.\n\n#### Permanent_Fix\n1. Use a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` to manage dependencies. For example, add:\n   ```\n   dexter_brain==1.0.0  # Replace with actual version\n   ```\n   Or, if it's a local package, install it in editable mode:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain\n   ```\n2. Consider using virtual environments to isolate dependencies and ensure consistency across deployments.\n\n#### Prevention\n1. Add pre-startup checks in `main.py` to validate critical imports:\n   ```python\n   try:\n       import dexter_brain\n   except ImportError:\n       logging.error(\"dexter_brain module not found. Check installation.\")\n       sys.exit(1)\n   ```\n2. Integrate dependency checks into your CI/CD pipeline. For example, in a GitHub Action:\n   ```yaml\n   - name: Check imports\n     run: |\n       python -c \"import dexter_brain\"\n   ```\n3. Use tools like `pylint` or `mypy` to catch import errors during development.\n\n#### Risk_Level\n**LOW**: The proposed solutions are standard practices for Python dependency management and involve minimal changes.\n\n#### Confidence\n**HIGH**: This is a well-understood issue in Python ecosystems, and the solutions are proven and widely adopted."
