  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`, specifically when attempting to import `create_sandbox` from `dexter_brain.sandbox` during system startup. This indicates that the Python environment running the backend application at `M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\main.py` does not have the `dexter_brain` package installed or accessible in its path. Given the severity and the fact that this is a startup error, it is likely that a recent deployment or environment change omitted this dependency, or the package was not properly installed or built.\n\n### Approach\nThe immediate goal is to restore system functionality by ensuring the `dexter_brain` module is available. The approach involves:\n1. Verifying the existence and correctness of the dependency management configuration (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, or `setup.py`).\n2. Installing the missing package in the environment.\n3. For a permanent fix, ensuring the deployment process includes dependency installation and validation.\n4. Implementing checks to prevent similar issues, such as pre-startup dependency verification.\n\n### Implementation\n\n**Immediate Action:**\n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is listed in the project's dependencies (e.g., in `requirements.txt`). If not, add it.\n2. Install the package using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install dexter_brain\n   ```\n   If the package is private or not on PyPI, ensure the correct repository URL is configured and install from there.\n3. Restart the application to verify the error is resolved.\n\n**Permanent Fix:**\n1. Update the project's dependency file (e.g., `requirements.txt`) to include `dexter_brain` with the correct version.\n2. Ensure the deployment script or CI/CD pipeline includes a step to install dependencies, e.g.:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n3. Consider using a virtual environment to isolate dependencies and avoid conflicts.\n\n**Prevention:**\n1. Add a pre-startup check in `main.py` to validate critical dependencies:\n   ```python\n   def check_dependencies():\n       required_modules = ['dexter_brain']\n       for module in required_modules:\n           try:\n               __import__(module)\n           except ImportError:\n               raise RuntimeError(f\"Missing required module: {module}\")\n   \n   # Call this function before attempting to import application modules\n   check_dependencies()\n   ```\n2. Integrate dependency checks into the CI/CD pipeline to fail builds if dependencies are missing or incompatible.\n3. Use logging or monitoring alerts to notify of missing dependencies during startup.\n\n**Risk_Level:** LOW  \n**Confidence:** HIGH\n\nThe solution involves standard dependency management practices with minimal risk. The immediate action is straightforward, and the permanent fix ensures future deployments include the necessary dependencies. The prevention measures add robustness to the system startup process."
