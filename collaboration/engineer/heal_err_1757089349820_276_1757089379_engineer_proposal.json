  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `HEALING_TIMEOUT` with ID `err_1757089349820_276` indicates that a healing session for a prior error (`err_1757070588039_1`) has timed out. Given the context that the source is `error_healer` and the high frequency of similar `HEALING_TIMEOUT` errors (102 instances), the root cause likely involves:\n1. **Resource Exhaustion**: The healing process may be consuming excessive CPU, memory, or I/O, causing timeouts.\n2. **Inefficient Healing Logic**: The error resolution algorithm might be stuck in a loop or handling edge cases poorly.\n3. **Concurrency Issues**: Multiple healing sessions may be contending for shared resources, leading to deadlocks or starvation.\n4. **System Overload**: With 192 recent errors and 2 critical ones, the system may be under too much load to complete healing in time.\n\nThe absence of a stack trace suggests the issue might be at the infrastructure or orchestration level rather than in application code.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Mitigation**: Temporarily pause non-critical healing sessions to free up resources for critical errors.\n2. **Investigate Healing Logic**: Review the `error_healer` module for inefficient code paths or unbounded loops.\n3. **Add Timeout Handling**: Implement graceful timeout mechanisms with fallbacks (e.g., retries, logging, or escalation).\n4. **Resource Monitoring**: Introduce real-time monitoring of CPU, memory, and I/O during healing sessions.\n5. **Permanent Fix**: Refactor the healing system to use asynchronous, non-blocking operations and prioritize errors based on severity.\n\n### Implementation\n#### Immediate_Action:\n1. **Reduce Load**: Temporarily suspend healing for non-critical errors (severity < MEDIUM) via configuration change.\n   ```yaml\n   # error_healer_config.yaml\n   healing:\n     enabled_severities: [\"CRITICAL\", \"HIGH\", \"MEDIUM\"]\n     timeout_ms: 30000  # Reduce from current value if too high\n   ```\n2. **Increase Timeout**: If feasible, slightly increase the timeout threshold for healing sessions (e.g., from 30s to 45s) to avoid false timeouts under load.\n3. **Log Diagnostics**: Add detailed logging for the next healing session to capture resource usage and execution path.\n\n#### Permanent_Fix:\n1. **Refactor Healing Logic**:\n   - Use asynchronous programming (e.g., async/await in Node.js/Python) to avoid blocking.\n   - Implement a circuit breaker pattern to stop retries after a threshold.\n   - Example code snippet for circuit breaker:\n   ```javascript\n   class HealingSession {\n     constructor(maxAttempts = 3, cooldownPeriod = 60000) {\n       this.attempts = 0;\n       this.maxAttempts = maxAttempts;\n       this.cooldownPeriod = cooldownPeriod;\n       this.lastFailure = null;\n     }\n\n     async heal(error) {\n       if (this.attempts >= this.maxAttempts) {\n         const now = Date.now();\n         if (now - this.lastFailure < this.cooldownPeriod) {\n           throw new Error(\"Healing circuit open\");\n         }\n         this.attempts = 0; // Reset after cooldown\n       }\n       this.attempts++;\n       try {\n         // Your healing logic here\n         const result = await performHealing(error);\n         this.attempts = 0; // Reset on success\n         return result;\n       } catch (e) {\n         this.lastFailure = Date.now();\n         throw e;\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n2. **Add Monitoring**:\n   - Integrate with APM tools (e.g., Datadog, Prometheus) to track healing session duration and resource usage.\n   - Set up alerts for healing timeouts or high resource consumption.\n\n#### Prevention:\n1. **Add Health Checks**: Implement a readiness probe for the `error_healer` service to avoid starting new sessions when overloaded.\n2. **Rate Limiting**: Limit the number of concurrent healing sessions based on available resources.\n3. **Error Classification**: Improve error categorization to avoid unnecessary healing for transient or non-actionable errors.\n\n#### Risk_Level: MEDIUM\n- Temporarily suspending healing for low-severity errors might delay resolution for some issues, but critical functionality remains protected.\n- Code changes require testing to avoid introducing new bugs.\n\n#### Confidence: HIGH\n- The approach addresses common causes of timeouts (resource contention, inefficient logic) and provides actionable steps.\n- The circuit breaker pattern is a proven method for handling repeated failures.\n\n**Collaboration Note**: This solution prioritizes stability and incremental improvement. Team should review the `error_healer` codebase to identify specific bottlenecks."
