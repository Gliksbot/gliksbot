The current UI shows a static list of files, which is not useful for observing live collaboration. The goal is to integrate an existing `ActivityStream` component that uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) to show live updates of LLM collaboration. This component is already implemented but not utilized in the `Normal.jsx` page. The task is to incorporate this component into the UI, replacing the static file list with a dynamic tabbed interface that allows switching between a live stream of activities and the static file list.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Import the `ActivityStream` Component**: Ensure the `ActivityStream` component is imported into `Normal.jsx`.\n\n2. **State Management for Tabs**: Introduce a state variable to manage the tab selection between \"Live Stream\" and \"Files\".\n\n3. **UI Structure Update**: Modify the UI to include tabs. The tabs will allow users to switch between viewing the live collaboration stream and the static file list.\n\n4. **Integration**: Replace the existing \"Collaboration Files\" section with the new tabbed interface. Ensure that the `ActivityStream` component is displayed when the \"Live Stream\" tab is selected.\n\n5. **Error Handling and Testing**: Ensure that the integration does not break existing functionality and that the live stream updates correctly.\n\n### Implementation\n\n```jsx\n// Normal.jsx\n\n// Step 1: Import the ActivityStream component\nimport ActivityStream from './path/to/ActivityStream';\n\n// Step 2: Add state for tab selection\nconst [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('liveStream');\n\n// Step 3: Update the UI structure to include tabs\nreturn (\n  <div>\n    {/* Other UI components */}\n    \n    <div className=\"collaboration-section\">\n      <div className=\"tabs\">\n        <button onClick={() => setActiveTab('liveStream')}>Live Stream</button>\n        <button onClick={() => setActiveTab('files')}>Files</button>\n      </div>\n      \n      <div className=\"tab-content\">\n        {activeTab === 'liveStream' && <ActivityStream />}\n        {activeTab === 'files' && (\n          <div>\n            {/* Existing file list rendering logic */}\n          </div>\n        )}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    \n    {/* Other UI components */}\n  </div>\n);\n\n// Ensure that the ActivityStream component is correctly rendering live updates\n```\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Styling**: Ensure that the tabs and content are styled appropriately to match the existing UI.\n- **Performance**: Monitor the performance impact of the live stream and optimize if necessary.\n- **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure that the live stream updates in real-time and that switching between tabs is seamless.\n\nThis approach ensures a smooth integration of real-time collaboration data into the existing UI, enhancing the user experience by providing dynamic and interactive content."
