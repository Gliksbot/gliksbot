  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` is a classic Python import failure, indicating that the required `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the environment where the application is running. The root cause is likely one of the following:\n- The `dexter_brain` package was never installed in the target environment.\n- The environment (e.g., virtual environment, container) was not properly set up or activated.\n- There is a version mismatch or dependency conflict preventing the module from being recognized.\n- The module is part of a private or internal package that hasn't been distributed to this environment.\n\nGiven the context (`STARTUP_ERROR`, critical severity), this is likely a deployment or environment configuration issue rather than a code bug.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Install the missing package or verify the environment setup.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure robust dependency management and environment replication.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks in CI/CD pipelines and startup routines to validate dependencies.\n4. **Risk Assessment**: The proposed solution is low-risk as it involves standard dependency management practices.\n\n### Implementation\n#### Immediate_Action:\nRun the following command in the environment where the application is hosted (e.g., virtual environment, container, server):\n```bash\npip install dexter_brain\n```\nIf `dexter_brain` is a private package, ensure you have the correct repository configured and credentials set:\n```bash\npip install --extra-index-url <private_repo_url> dexter_brain\n```\nAlternatively, if the package is local, install it from the source:\n```bash\npip install /path/to/dexter_brain\n```\n\n#### Permanent_Fix:\n1. **Use a requirements.txt or pyproject.toml** to explicitly list all dependencies.\n   Example `requirements.txt`:\n   ```\n   dexter_brain==1.0.0  # or appropriate version\n   other_dependency==x.y.z\n   ```\n2. **Automate dependency installation** in your deployment script or Dockerfile:\n   ```dockerfile\n   FROM python:3.9\n   COPY requirements.txt .\n   RUN pip install -r requirements.txt\n   COPY . .\n   CMD [\"python\", \"main.py\"]\n   ```\n3. **Use virtual environments** to isolate dependencies and ensure consistency.\n\n#### Prevention:\n- Add a dependency check at startup:\n  ```python\n  try:\n      import dexter_brain\n  except ImportError:\n      logging.critical(\"Missing required package: dexter_brain\")\n      sys.exit(1)\n  ```\n- Integrate dependency checks in CI/CD pipelines (e.g., fail build if requirements.txt is not satisfied).\n- Use tools like `pip check` to verify installed dependencies.\n\n#### Risk_Level: LOW\n- Installing a missing dependency is a standard operation with minimal risk.\n- If the package is not available in public repositories, ensure private repository access is configured correctly.\n\n#### Confidence: HIGH\n- This is a common issue with well-established solutions in Python environments.\n- The approach is straightforward and has been proven in production systems.\n\n### Collaboration Note\nIf `dexter_brain` is a custom module developed in-house, ensure it is properly packaged and distributed to all environments. Consider using a private PyPI server or packaging it as part of the deployment artifact."
