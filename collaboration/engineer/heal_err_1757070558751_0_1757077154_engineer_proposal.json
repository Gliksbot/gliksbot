  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during the startup of the application. This is a critical startup error, likely caused by:\n- The module not being installed in the current Python environment.\n- The module being installed in a different environment than the one being used.\n- A misconfiguration in the project's dependencies or environment setup (e.g., missing entry in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`).\n- The module path not being included in `PYTHONPATH`.\n\nGiven the stack trace points to `line 120` in `main.py` during `startup_event`, this is a dependency issue rather than a runtime logic error.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing module if it exists, or check for typographical errors in the import statement.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure the module is properly documented as a dependency and included in the project's dependency management (e.g., `requirements.txt`).\n3. **Prevention**: Implement dependency checks during CI/CD pipelines and use virtual environments to avoid environment discrepancies.\n\n### Implementation\n\n#### Immediate_Action:\n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is available on PyPI or a private repository:\n   ```bash\n   pip search dexter_brain\n   ```\n   If it is available, install it:\n   ```bash\n   pip install dexter_brain\n   ```\n2. If it is not available on PyPI, it might be a local module. Check the project structure for a `dexter_brain` directory or ensure it is in the Python path.\n3. Verify the current Python environment:\n   ```bash\n   which python  # or where python on Windows\n   pip list | grep dexter_brain\n   ```\n4. If the module is local, ensure the project root is in `PYTHONPATH` or adjust the import statement to use relative imports if applicable.\n\n#### Permanent_Fix:\n1. Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`:\n   ```txt\n   # requirements.txt\n   dexter_brain==1.0.0  # replace with actual version\n   ```\n2. Use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\\Scripts\\activate on Windows\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n3. If `dexter_brain` is a local module, ensure it is properly packaged or included in the project structure with an `__init__.py` file.\n\n#### Prevention:\n1. Implement a pre-startup check in `main.py` to validate critical dependencies:\n   ```python\n   def check_dependencies():\n       required_modules = ['dexter_brain']\n       for module in required_modules:\n           try:\n               __import__(module)\n           except ImportError:\n               raise RuntimeError(f\"Missing required module: {module}\")\n   ```\n   Call this function before attempting to import other modules.\n2. Use CI/CD pipelines to run dependency checks and tests in an isolated environment before deployment.\n3. Document the setup process clearly, including environment activation and dependency installation.\n\n#### Risk_Level: LOW\nThe solutions involve standard dependency management practices with minimal risk of disrupting operations.\n\n#### Confidence: HIGH\nThis is a common issue with well-established solutions in Python development."
