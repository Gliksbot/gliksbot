  "content": "**Analysis:**\nThe error pattern \"HEALING_TIMEOUT:error_healer\" occurring 4 times in 10 minutes suggests that the error healing subsystem itself is failing to complete its operations within expected time limits. This indicates either:\n1. The healing process is encountering complex errors that require excessive processing time\n2. Resource contention (CPU/memory/IO) is slowing down healing operations\n3. The timeout threshold is set too aggressively for current system load\n4. A recursive error condition where healing attempts are triggering additional errors\n\nGiven the high number of recent errors (512) and pattern-detected errors (501), this appears to be a systemic issue rather than an isolated incident.\n\n**Approach:**\n1. **Immediate**: Implement circuit breaker pattern for error healing to prevent cascading failures\n2. **Diagnostic**: Add detailed logging and metrics to the error_healer process\n3. **Optimization**: Review and adjust timeout thresholds based on current system performance\n4. **Architectural**: Implement graceful degradation for healing operations under high load\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n```python\n# SKILL_SPEC: Enhanced Error Healer with Circuit Breaker\nclass CircuitBreaker:\n    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=3, reset_timeout=60):\n        self.failure_count = 0\n        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold\n        self.reset_timeout = reset_timeout\n        self.last_failure_time = None\n        self.state = \"CLOSED\"\n    \n    def execute(self, operation, *args, **kwargs):\n        if self.state == \"OPEN\":\n            if time.time() - self.last_failure_time > self.reset_timeout:\n                self.state = \"HALF_OPEN\"\n            else:\n                raise CircuitBreakerOpenException()\n        \n        try:\n            result = operation(*args, **kwargs)\n            if self.state == \"HALF_OPEN\":\n                self.state = \"CLOSED\"\n                self.failure_count = 0\n            return result\n        except Exception as e:\n            self.failure_count += 1\n            self.last_failure_time = time.time()\n            \n            if self.failure_count >= self.failure_threshold:\n                self.state = \"OPEN\"\n            \n            raise\n\nclass EnhancedErrorHealer:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.circuit_breaker = CircuitBreaker(failure_threshold=2, reset_timeout=300)\n        self.metrics = HealingMetricsCollector()\n    \n    def heal_error(self, error_id):\n        try:\n            return self.circuit_breaker.execute(self._safe_heal, error_id)\n        except CircuitBreakerOpenException:\n            self.metrics.record_circuit_breaker_trip()\n            # Fallback to basic healing or queue for later processing\n            return self._basic_heal(error_id)\n    \n    def _safe_heal(self, error_id):\n        with self.metrics.track_healing_time():\n            # Existing healing logic with timeout enforcement\n            result = self._perform_healing(error_id)\n            return result\n    \n    def _basic_heal(self, error_id):\n        # Simplified healing that cannot timeout\n        return {\"status\": \"queued\", \"error_id\": error_id}\n```\n\n**Additional Immediate Actions:**\n1. Increase healing timeout threshold by 50% temporarily\n2. Implement healing operation prioritization (critical errors first)\n3. Add resource monitoring to throttle healing during system overload\n\n**Risk_Level:** MEDIUM (circuit breaker implementation requires careful tuning)\n**Confidence:** HIGH (pattern addresses root cause of cascading healing failures)"
