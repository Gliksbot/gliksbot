  "content": "### Analysis\nThe `HEALING_TIMEOUT` error indicates that the `error_healer` subsystem itself is failing to complete its healing process within the expected timeframe. Given that the source is `error_healer`, this suggests a recursive or cascading failure where the system responsible for error recovery is encountering issues. The root cause likely involves one or more of the following:\n- **Resource exhaustion**: The healing process may be consuming excessive CPU, memory, or I/O, leading to timeouts.\n- **Blocking operations**: Long-running or synchronous tasks within the healing logic that aren't optimized for timeout constraints.\n- **Concurrency issues**: High system load (as indicated by \"Recent Errors: 1000\") may be overwhelming the healing mechanism, causing delays.\n- **Inefficient healing logic**: The healing process for the original error (`err_1757086850365_103`) might be stuck in a loop or waiting on external dependencies.\n\nSince the stack trace is unavailable, the diagnosis is based on common patterns in self-healing systems. The immediate risk is that repeated timeouts could lead to a failure cascade, degrading system stability.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Implement a circuit breaker for the healing subsystem to prevent recursive failures and reduce load.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Refactor the healing logic to be asynchronous, non-blocking, and resource-aware, with explicit timeouts and fallbacks.\n3. **Prevention**: Add monitoring and alerting for healing timeouts, and introduce load shedding during high-error scenarios.\n\n### Implementation\n#### Immediate Action (Circuit Breaker):\n```python\n# SKILL_SPEC: Circuit breaker for error_healer to avoid recursive timeouts\nclass HealingCircuitBreaker:\n    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=3, reset_timeout=60):\n        self.failure_count = 0\n        self.threshold = failure_threshold\n        self.reset_timeout = reset_timeout\n        self.last_failure_time = None\n        self.state = \"CLOSED\"  # States: CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN\n\n    def execute(self, healing_func, *args, **kwargs):\n        if self.state == \"OPEN\":\n            if time.time() - self.last_failure_time > self.reset_timeout:\n                self.state = \"HALF_OPEN\"\n            else:\n                raise Exception(\"Circuit breaker open - healing disabled\")\n        \n        try:\n            result = healing_func(*args, **kwargs)\n            self._on_success()\n            return result\n        except Exception as e:\n            self._on_failure()\n            raise e\n\n    def _on_success(self):\n        if self.state == \"HALF_OPEN\":\n            self.state = \"CLOSED\"\n        self.failure_count = 0\n\n    def _on_failure(self):\n        self.failure_count += 1\n        self.last_failure_time = time.time()\n        if self.failure_count >= self.threshold:\n            self.state = \"OPEN\"\n\n# Usage in error_healer:\nhealing_breaker = HealingCircuitBreaker()\ntry:\n    healing_breaker.execute(heal_error, error_id)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    log(\"Healing skipped due to circuit breaker\")\n```\n\n#### Permanent Fix (Async Healing with Timeouts):\nRestructure the healing process to use asynchronous tasks with explicit timeouts. For example, using Python's `asyncio`:\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def heal_error_async(error_id, timeout=30):\n    try:\n        await asyncio.wait_for(_perform_healing(error_id), timeout=timeout)\n    except asyncio.TimeoutError:\n        log(f\"Healing timed out for {error_id}\")\n        # Optionally queue for retry or mark as failed\n```\n\n#### Prevention:\n- Add metrics and alerts for `healing_timeout` events.\n- Implement load-aware healing: during high error rates, prioritize critical errors and defer others.\n- Use distributed tracing to identify bottlenecks in healing logic.\n\n### Risk Assessment\n- **Risk_Level**: LOW. The circuit breaker is a defensive pattern that prevents cascading failures without disrupting core operations.\n- **Confidence**: HIGH. This approach is based on proven resilience patterns and is minimally invasive.\n\nThis solution balances immediate mitigation with long-term stability, ensuring the healing subsystem doesn't become a single point of failure."
