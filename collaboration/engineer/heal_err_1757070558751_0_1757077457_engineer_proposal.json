  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`, specifically when attempting to import `create_sandbox` from `dexter_brain.sandbox`. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package in the current environment. The root cause is likely one of the following:\n- The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the environment where the application is running.\n- The package is installed but not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect virtual environment, missing `__init__.py`, or misconfigured PYTHONPATH).\n- There may be a version mismatch or a broken installation.\n- The codebase might have been moved or restructured without updating the import paths.\n\nGiven the severity (CRITICAL) and the context (startup error), this is blocking the application from initializing.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing package if it exists, or check the integrity of the existing installation.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure the dependency is properly declared and managed via a requirements file or a package manager like pip, and validate the environment setup during deployment.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks in the CI/CD pipeline to validate all dependencies before deployment, and use virtual environments to isolate dependencies.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate Action Steps** (execute in order):\n1. Check if the `dexter_brain` package is installed:\n   ```bash\n   pip list | grep dexter_brain\n   ```\n   If not found, install it (if it's available on PyPI or a private index):\n   ```bash\n   pip install dexter_brain\n   ```\n   If it's a local package, install it in editable mode from the correct path:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain\n   ```\n2. Validate the Python path and ensure the environment is activated (if using virtualenv/conda):\n   ```bash\n   which python  # Check the Python interpreter path\n   echo $PYTHONPATH  # Check additional paths\n   ```\n3. Restart the application after installation.\n\n**Permanent Fix**:\n- Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` to ensure it is tracked as a dependency.\n- Use a virtual environment and automate environment setup with scripts or tools like `pipenv`/`poetry`.\n- In the codebase, add a check at startup to validate critical dependencies:\n   ```python\n   try:\n       import dexter_brain\n   except ModuleNotFoundError:\n       logging.critical(\"Dependency 'dexter_brain' is missing. Please install it.\")\n       sys.exit(1)\n   ```\n\n**Prevention**:\n- In CI/CD, add a step to install dependencies and run a dry-start to catch missing modules:\n   ```yaml\n   # Example GitHub Actions step\n   - name: Validate dependencies\n     run: |\n       pip install -r requirements.txt\n       python -c \"import dexter_brain; print('OK')\"\n   ```\n- Set up alerts for `ModuleNotFoundError` in logs.\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH"
