  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`, specifically when attempting to import `create_sandbox` from `dexter_brain.sandbox` during system startup. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package in the current environment. The root cause is likely one of the following:\n- The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the environment.\n- The package is installed but not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect virtual environment, misconfigured PYTHONPATH).\n- There is a version mismatch or corruption in the package installation.\n- The import statement has a typo or incorrect module structure (though the stack trace suggests the module exists in the codebase).\n\nGiven the context (startup error, no prior context available), the most probable cause is a missing or improperly configured dependency.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing package if it exists in the project's requirements.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure dependency management is robust—use a virtual environment, maintain a requirements.txt or pyproject.toml, and automate dependency installation during deployment.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks in the CI/CD pipeline to validate dependencies before deployment and use logging to capture environment details at startup.\n\n### Implementation\n\n**Immediate_Action**:\n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is listed in the project's dependencies (e.g., requirements.txt). If it is, run:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n   If not, check the project structure—it might be a local package. If it is local, ensure it is installed in editable mode:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain\n   ```\n2. Verify the Python path and environment:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   print(sys.path)\n   ```\n   Ensure the path includes the directory containing `dexter_brain`.\n\n**Permanent_Fix**:\n- Use a virtual environment (e.g., venv, conda) to isolate dependencies.\n- Maintain a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` with all dependencies.\n- Automate dependency installation in the startup script or Dockerfile.\n- If `dexter_brain` is a local module, structure it as a package with `__init__.py` and include it in the project's setup.\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Add a pre-startup check in `main.py` to validate critical dependencies:\n  ```python\n  try:\n      import dexter_brain\n  except ModuleNotFoundError:\n      logging.critical(\"Dependency missing: dexter_brain\")\n      sys.exit(1)\n  ```\n- Integrate dependency checks in CI/CD (e.g., test installation in a clean environment).\n- Log environment details (Python version, installed packages) at startup for debugging.\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH"
