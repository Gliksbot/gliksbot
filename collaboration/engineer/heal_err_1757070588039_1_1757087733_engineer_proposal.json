  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`, specifically when attempting to import `create_sandbox` from `dexter_brain.sandbox` during system startup. This indicates that the Python environment lacks the required `dexter_brain` package. The root cause is likely one of the following:\n- The package was not installed in the current environment.\n- The package was installed but is not available in the Python path (e.g., due to virtual environment issues or incorrect installation).\n- There might be a version mismatch or a broken installation.\n- The codebase might rely on a local or development version of `dexter_brain` that hasn't been deployed or linked properly.\n\nGiven the context of a startup error and the absence of additional context, the most probable cause is a missing dependency in the deployment or runtime environment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Verify the environment**: Check if the Python environment has the `dexter_brain` package installed.\n2. **Install missing dependencies**: If the package is missing, install it using the appropriate method (e.g., pip, from source, or from a private repository).\n3. **Validate the fix**: Ensure the system can start without errors after installation.\n4. **Implement safeguards**: Add checks to validate dependencies at startup or during deployment to prevent recurrence.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate Action**:\nRun the following command in the environment where the application is hosted to install the `dexter_brain` package:\n```bash\npip install dexter_brain\n```\nIf the package is not available on PyPI, you may need to install it from a source repository or a private package index. For example:\n```bash\npip install git+https://github.com/your_org/dexter_brain.git\n```\nor if using a requirements file:\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\nEnsure that the requirements file includes `dexter_brain` with the correct version.\n\n**Permanent Fix**:\n- Maintain a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` file with all dependencies explicitly listed.\n- Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies and ensure consistency across deployments.\n- Implement CI/CD checks to validate that all dependencies are installed correctly before deployment.\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Add a startup check to validate critical dependencies. For example, in `main.py`, before importing `dexter_brain`, you can add:\n```python\ntry:\n    import dexter_brain\nexcept ImportError:\n    logging.critical(\"Dependency 'dexter_brain' is missing. Please install it.\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n```\n- Use tools like `pip check` in your deployment pipeline to verify that all dependencies are satisfied.\n- Consider using containerization (e.g., Docker) to encapsulate the environment and dependencies.\n\n**Risk Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH"
