  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`, specifically when attempting to import `create_sandbox` from `dexter_brain.sandbox`. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package in the current environment. Possible root causes include:\n- The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the environment.\n- The package is installed but in a different Python environment or path.\n- There may be a typo or naming inconsistency in the import statement or package structure.\n- The package might be part of a local development setup that hasn't been properly deployed or linked.\n\nGiven the context of a startup error in a backend system (`main.py`), it is likely that the deployment or environment setup is incomplete or misconfigured.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing package if it exists in a repository, or check for local development setups.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure proper dependency management and environment consistency across development, staging, and production.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks in the CI/CD pipeline to validate all dependencies before deployment, and use virtual environments to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Implementation\n\n#### Immediate_Action:\n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is listed in the project's dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`). If not, add it.\n2. Install the package using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install dexter_brain\n   ```\n   If it's a local package, install it in editable mode:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain\n   ```\n3. Restart the application to see if the error resolves.\n\n#### Permanent_Fix:\n1. **Dependency Management**: Use a `requirements.txt` file or a `pyproject.toml` with precise versioning to ensure consistent environments.\n   Example `requirements.txt` entry:\n   ```\n   dexter_brain==1.0.0\n   ```\n2. **Environment Isolation**: Use virtual environments (e.g., `venv` or `conda`) to avoid system-wide package conflicts.\n3. **CI/CD Integration**: Add a step in the deployment pipeline to install dependencies and verify all imports before deployment.\n\n#### Prevention:\n1. **Pre-deployment Checks**: Run a script that attempts to import all critical modules during the CI/CD process.\n   Example script:\n   ```python\n   try:\n       from dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox\n       print(\"✓ dexter_brain import successful\")\n   except ImportError as e:\n       print(f\"✗ Import failed: {e}\")\n       exit(1)\n   ```\n2. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for missing module errors during startup.\n3. **Documentation**: Ensure the setup process clearly includes steps to install all required packages.\n\n#### Risk_Level: LOW\nThe solution involves standard dependency management practices with minimal risk of introducing new issues.\n\n#### Confidence: HIGH\nThis is a common issue in Python projects, and the proposed solutions are well-established and effective."
