  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during the import process. This typically occurs due to:\n- The module not being installed in the current Python environment.\n- The module's path not being included in `sys.path`.\n- A mismatch between the environment where the code is running and where dependencies are installed.\n- Potential issues with virtual environment activation or dependency management.\n\nGiven that this is a startup error and the system has encountered multiple recent errors, it's likely related to environment setup or deployment issues rather than code logic.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify and install the missing module to restore system functionality.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure robust dependency management and environment consistency.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks and automation to validate environments before deployment.\n\n### Implementation\n\n#### Immediate_Action\n1. **Check if `dexter_brain` is installed**:\n   ```bash\n   pip list | grep dexter_brain\n   ```\n   If not found, install it:\n   ```bash\n   pip install dexter_brain\n   ```\n   If it's a local module, ensure it's in the Python path or install it in development mode:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify Python path**:\n   Temporarily add the module's path to `sys.path` in `main.py` before the import:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   sys.path.append('/path/to/dexter_brain')\n   from dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox\n   ```\n   *Note: This is a temporary workaround.*\n\n3. **Restart the application** after taking the above steps.\n\n#### Permanent_Fix\n1. **Use a requirements.txt or setup.py** to manage dependencies:\n   Ensure `dexter_brain` is listed in `requirements.txt`:\n   ```\n   dexter_brain==1.0.0  # or appropriate version\n   ```\n   Install dependencies during deployment:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n2. **Use a virtual environment** to isolate dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n3. **Validate environment on startup**:\n   Add a check in `main.py` to verify critical modules:\n   ```python\n   def check_dependencies():\n       try:\n           import dexter_brain\n       except ImportError:\n           logging.critical(\"Missing dexter_brain module. Please install dependencies.\")\n           sys.exit(1)\n   ```\n   Call this function before attempting to import from `dexter_brain`.\n\n#### Prevention\n1. **Automated Dependency Checks**:\n   - Use CI/CD pipelines to run `pip check` or validate `requirements.txt` before deployment.\n   - Implement health checks that verify all required modules are importable.\n\n2. **Environment Consistency**:\n   - Use containerization (e.g., Docker) to ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production.\n   - Example Dockerfile:\n     ```dockerfile\n     FROM python:3.9-slim\n     WORKDIR /app\n     COPY requirements.txt .\n     RUN pip install -r requirements.txt\n     COPY . .\n     CMD [\"python\", \"main.py\"]\n     ```\n\n3. **Monitoring and Alerts**:\n   - Set up alerts for missing dependencies or import errors during startup.\n   - Log environment details (e.g., `sys.path`, installed packages) on startup for debugging.\n\n#### Risk_Level\n**LOW**: The proposed solutions involve standard dependency management practices and minimal code changes. The immediate action is reversible and low-risk.\n\n#### Confidence\n**HIGH**: This is a common issue with well-established solutions. The steps provided are practical and widely used in Python development."
