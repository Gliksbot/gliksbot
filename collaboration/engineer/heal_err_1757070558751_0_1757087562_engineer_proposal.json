  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`, specifically when attempting to import `create_sandbox` from `dexter_brain.sandbox` during system startup. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package in the current environment. Possible root causes include:\n- The package is not installed in the environment.\n- The package is installed but not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect virtual environment, misconfigured PYTHONPATH).\n- The package name or module structure has changed (e.g., renamed or refactored).\n- The codebase has a dependency management issue (e.g., requirements.txt not updated or installed).\n\nGiven the context (startup error, critical severity, and repeated occurrences), this is likely an environment or dependency configuration problem rather than a code logic error.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Mitigation**: Verify the environment and install the missing package if it exists, or check for alternative installation methods.\n2. **Root Cause Resolution**: Ensure dependency management is robust, using virtual environments and version-controlled requirements.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks during deployment/startup to validate all dependencies are available before proceeding.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate_Action**: \n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is installed by running `pip list | grep dexter_brain` (Unix) or `pip list | findstr dexter_brain` (Windows) in the environment.\n2. If not installed, attempt to install it via pip if it's a public package: `pip install dexter_brain`.\n3. If it's a private package, ensure it is built and installed from the source (e.g., `pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain`).\n4. If the package is installed but not found, verify the Python path and virtual environment activation.\n\n**Permanent_Fix**:\n1. Use a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` to declare dependencies explicitly.\n2. Implement a virtual environment (e.g., venv, conda) to isolate dependencies.\n3. Add a pre-startup check in `main.py` to validate critical imports:\n   ```python\n   def check_dependencies():\n       required_modules = ['dexter_brain']\n       for module in required_modules:\n           try:\n               __import__(module)\n           except ImportError:\n               raise RuntimeError(f\"Missing required module: {module}\")\n   ```\n   Call this function before attempting to import application-specific modules.\n\n**Prevention**:\n1. Use CI/CD pipelines to run dependency checks and tests before deployment.\n2. Monitor system logs for `ModuleNotFoundError` and trigger alerts.\n3. Document the dependency installation process clearly in the project README.\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW (dependency installation and validation are standard practices).\n**Confidence**: HIGH (this is a common issue with straightforward solutions).\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (if needed for environment setup)\nNot required for this solution, as it relies on standard Python dependency management."
