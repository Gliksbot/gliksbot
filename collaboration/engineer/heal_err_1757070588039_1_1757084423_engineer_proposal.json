  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` is a critical startup failure indicating that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module. This typically occurs due to one of the following root causes:\n- The module is not installed in the current Python environment.\n- The module exists but is not on the Python path.\n- There is a version mismatch or dependency issue.\n- The module was renamed, moved, or deleted.\n\nGiven the stack trace points to `line 120` in `main.py` attempting to import from `dexter_brain.sandbox`, it is likely that `dexter_brain` is a custom package or third-party dependency that is missing from the environment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the installation status of `dexter_brain` and install it if missing.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure dependency management is robust using a requirements.txt or environment configuration.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement pre-startup checks and dependency validation in the CI/CD pipeline.\n4. **Risk Assessment**: The proposed solution is low-risk as it involves standard dependency resolution.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate_Action**:  \nRun the following command in the backend directory to install the missing module (assuming it is available via pip or a similar package manager):  \n```bash\npip install dexter_brain\n```\nIf `dexter_brain` is a local module, ensure it is in the Python path or install it in development mode:  \n```bash\npip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain\n```\n\n**Permanent_Fix**:  \nAdd `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` to ensure it is installed with other dependencies. For example, in `requirements.txt`:  \n```\ndexter_brain==1.0.0  # specify the correct version\n```\nUse a virtual environment and automate dependency installation during deployment.\n\n**Prevention**:  \n- Add a pre-flight check in `main.py` to validate critical dependencies before startup:  \n```python\ntry:\n    import dexter_brain\nexcept ImportError:\n    logging.critical(\"Dependency missing: dexter_brain\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n```\n- Integrate dependency checks into CI/CD pipelines to catch missing modules early.\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH"
