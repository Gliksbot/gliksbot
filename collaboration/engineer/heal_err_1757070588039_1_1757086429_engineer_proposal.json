  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`, specifically when attempting to import `create_sandbox` from `dexter_brain.sandbox` during startup. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package in the current environment. Potential root causes include:\n- The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the environment.\n- The package is installed but in a different Python environment than the one being used.\n- There is a typo in the module name or the module path is incorrect.\n- The package exists but is not properly configured (e.g., missing `__init__.py` files if it's a local module).\n\nGiven the context (startup error, no prior context available), the most likely cause is that the required package is missing from the deployment environment or the virtual environment is not activated correctly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing package if it exists in the project requirements.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure dependency management is robust, using a requirements.txt or similar to track and install all necessary packages.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks during deployment or startup to validate all dependencies are present before attempting to import them.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate_Action**: \n- Check if `dexter_brain` is listed in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`. If it is, run:\n  ```bash\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  ```\n- If `dexter_brain` is a local module (not a PyPI package), ensure it is in the Python path. You might need to adjust `sys.path` or set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to include the directory containing `dexter_brain`.\n- As a temporary workaround, if the module is critical and missing, comment out the failing import and related code (if non-critical) to allow the system to start, but note this is a stopgap.\n\n**Permanent_Fix**:\n- If `dexter_brain` is an external package, add it to `requirements.txt` and ensure your deployment process includes installing dependencies.\n- If it is a local module, structure your project properly (e.g., place it in a subdirectory with `__init__.py`) and use relative imports or package installation (via `setup.py` or `pip install -e .`).\n- Example: If `dexter_brain` is a local package in the project, your project structure should be:\n  ```\n  project_root/\n  ├── dexter_brain/\n  │   ├── __init__.py\n  │   └── sandbox.py\n  ├── main.py\n  └── requirements.txt\n  ```\n  Then, ensure the root is in the Python path or install it in editable mode.\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Add a pre-startup check script that validates all required modules are importable. For example:\n  ```python\n  required_modules = ['dexter_brain']\n  for module in required_modules:\n      try:\n          __import__(module)\n      except ImportError:\n          logging.error(f\"Missing required module: {module}\")\n          sys.exit(1)\n  ```\n- Integrate this check into your CI/CD pipeline to catch missing dependencies early.\n- Use virtual environments consistently to avoid environment conflicts.\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW (installing a missing package or adjusting paths is low risk, but ensure backups before changes)\n**Confidence**: HIGH (common issue with straightforward solutions)\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (if needed for pre-startup check)\nNo new skill is strictly required, but if you want to automate dependency validation, here is a simple function:\n\n```python\ndef check_dependencies(modules):\n    missing = []\n    for module in modules:\n        try:\n            __import__(module)\n        except ImportError:\n            missing.append(module)\n    if missing:\n        raise ImportError(f\"Missing required modules: {missing}\")\n    return True\n\n# Usage in startup:\nrequired = ['dexter_brain', 'other_critical_package']\ncheck_dependencies(required)\n```\n\nThis approach ensures the system fails fast with a clear error message if dependencies are missing."
