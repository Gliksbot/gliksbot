  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`, specifically when attempting to import `from dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox` during startup. This indicates that the Python environment lacks the required `dexter_brain` package. Possible root causes include:\n- The package was not installed in the current environment.\n- There is a mismatch between the environment where the code is running and where dependencies were installed.\n- The package might be part of a local development setup that hasn't been deployed or linked correctly.\n\nGiven the context of a startup error in a backend system (`M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\main.py`), it is likely that the deployment or environment setup is incomplete or incorrect.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing package if it exists in a repository, or check for local setup instructions.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure dependency management is robust, using a requirements.txt or a similar dependency file, and automate environment setup.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks in the deployment pipeline to validate all dependencies before startup, and use virtual environments to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate_Action**:\n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is available on PyPI or a private package index by running: `pip search dexter_brain` or `pip install dexter_brain`.\n2. If it is not available publicly, look for a local copy or a repository URL. It might be a local package; in that case, install it from source: `pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain`.\n3. If the package is missing entirely, check the project documentation or repository for setup instructions.\n\n**Permanent_Fix**:\n1. Create a `requirements.txt` file (if not exists) listing all dependencies, including `dexter_brain` with its version or source.\n2. Use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. For example:\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n3. Automate this process in the deployment script or use a tool like Docker to ensure consistent environments.\n\n**Prevention**:\n1. Add a pre-startup check in `main.py` to validate critical dependencies:\n   ```python\n   try:\n       import dexter_brain\n   except ImportError:\n       logging.critical(\"Missing dexter_brain module. Please install dependencies.\")\n       sys.exit(1)\n   ```\n2. Integrate dependency checks into CI/CD pipelines to catch missing modules before deployment.\n3. Use dependency management tools like `pipenv` or `poetry` for better reliability.\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH\n\nThis approach is low risk as it involves standard dependency management practices that are non-disruptive and reversible. The confidence is high because missing module errors are common and well-understood in Python environments."
