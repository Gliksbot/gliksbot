  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `HEALING_TIMEOUT` indicates that the `error_healer` subsystem itself is failing to resolve another error (`err_1757070588039_1`) within an expected timeframe. Given the context:\n- The `error_healer` is likely a service or module responsible for automated error recovery.\n- A timeout suggests either the healing process is stuck (e.g., infinite loop, deadlock) or the error is too complex to resolve quickly.\n- High frequency of similar `HEALING_TIMEOUT` errors (15 related instances) points to a systemic issue, possibly resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, or I/O bottlenecks) or a flawed healing algorithm for certain error types.\n- Since the stack trace is unavailable, the root cause might involve asynchronous operations, unhandled exceptions in the healing logic, or dependency timeouts (e.g., database, external APIs).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Mitigation**: Isolate the problematic healing session to prevent cascading failures and allow the system to continue processing other errors.\n2. **Diagnosis**: Enhance logging and monitoring around the `error_healer` to capture detailed traces during healing attempts.\n3. **Long-term Fix**: Refactor the healing logic to include timeouts, circuit breakers, and better error handling for itself.\n4. **Prevention**: Implement proactive health checks and resource usage alerts for the `error_healer` subsystem.\n\n### Implementation\n#### Immediate_Action:\n- **Step 1**: Manually terminate the stuck healing session (`session_id: heal_err_1757070588039_1_1757078559`) to free up resources. If the system has an admin API, use it to cancel the session. Example pseudo-code for cancellation:\n  ```bash\n  curl -X POST https://<system-api>/healing/sessions/heal_err_1757070588039_1_1757078559/cancel\n  ```\n- **Step 2**: Temporarily increase the timeout threshold for healing sessions (if configurable) to reduce timeouts while investigating.\n- **Step 3**: Route new errors of type `err_1757070588039_1` to a fallback mechanism (e.g., manual review queue) until fixed.\n\n#### Permanent_Fix:\n- **Code Change**: Modify the `error_healer` to enforce a hard timeout on each healing attempt. Use asynchronous programming with a timeout guard. Example in Python (using asyncio):\n  ```python\n  import asyncio\n  from functools import wraps\n\n  def with_timeout(timeout_seconds):\n      def decorator(func):\n          @wraps(func)\n          async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n              try:\n                  return await asyncio.wait_for(func(*args, **kwargs), timeout=timeout_seconds)\n              except asyncio.TimeoutError:\n                  logging.error(f\"Healing session timed out after {timeout_seconds}s\")\n                  raise HealingTimeoutError()\n          return wrapper\n      return decorator\n\n  @with_timeout(30)  # 30-second timeout\n  async def heal_error(error_id):\n      # Existing healing logic\n  ```\n- **Resource Management**: Implement circuit breakers (e.g., using libraries like `resilience4j` or `polly`) to skip healing after repeated timeouts and avoid resource exhaustion.\n- **Retry Strategy**: Use exponential backoff for retries instead of fixed attempts.\n\n#### Prevention:\n- **Monitoring**: Add metrics for healing session duration, success rates, and resource usage (CPU, memory). Trigger alerts if thresholds are breached.\n- **Logging**: Ensure detailed stack traces are logged for all healing errors, including timeouts.\n- **Testing**: Introduce chaos engineering tests to simulate timeout scenarios and validate resilience.\n\n#### Risk_Level: MEDIUM\n- Immediate actions are low-risk but may delay healing for some errors.\n- Code changes require careful testing to avoid introducing new bugs in the error healing flow.\n\n#### Confidence: HIGH\n- Timeout handling and circuit breakers are proven patterns for improving system resilience.\n- The approach addresses the core issue without disrupting overall system stability.\n\n### Collaboration Note:\nI recommend the team focuses on implementing the timeout decorator and enhanced monitoring as the highest priority. If the system lacks async capabilities, a thread-based timeout can be used instead. Let me know if you need a SKILL_SPEC for specific languages or frameworks."
