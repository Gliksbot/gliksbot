This involves accessing the file system to perform operations such as reading files, listing directories, and possibly parsing file contents. The skill should be able to handle various file types and structures commonly found in repositories, such as source code files, configuration files, and documentation.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Define the Scope**: The skill should focus on reading and interpreting the contents of a repository. This includes:\n   - Listing files and directories.\n   - Reading file contents.\n   - Identifying file types and possibly parsing specific formats (e.g., JSON, YAML, Markdown).\n\n2. **Security Considerations**: Ensure that the skill operates within a secure environment, with appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized access or modifications to the file system.\n\n3. **Language and Framework**: Choose a language and framework that supports file system operations efficiently. Python is a good choice due to its extensive libraries for file handling and parsing.\n\n4. **Modular Design**: Implement the skill in a modular fashion to allow easy extension and maintenance. Separate components for file listing, reading, and parsing.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage scenarios such as file not found, permission issues, and unsupported file formats.\n\n### Implementation\n\n#### SKILL_SPEC\n\n```yaml\nname: FileSystemReader\ndescription: A skill to interact with the file system to read and interpret repository contents.\ninputs:\n  - name: repository_path\n    type: string\n    description: The path to the repository to be read.\noutputs:\n  - name: file_list\n    type: list\n    description: A list of files and directories in the repository.\n  - name: file_contents\n    type: dict\n    description: A dictionary with file paths as keys and their contents as values.\n  - name: errors\n    type: list\n    description: A list of errors encountered during the operation.\n```\n\n#### Code\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport json\nimport yaml\n\nclass FileSystemReader:\n    def __init__(self, repository_path):\n        self.repository_path = repository_path\n        self.file_list = []\n        self.file_contents = {}\n        self.errors = []\n\n    def list_files(self):\n        try:\n            for root, dirs, files in os.walk(self.repository_path):\n                for name in files:\n                    self.file_list.append(os.path.join(root, name))\n        except Exception as e:\n            self.errors.append(str(e))\n\n    def read_files(self):\n        for file_path in self.file_list:\n            try:\n                with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n                    if file_path.endswith('.json'):\n                        self.file_contents[file_path] = json.load(file)\n                    elif file_path.endswith(('.yml', '.yaml')):\n                        self.file_contents[file_path] = yaml.safe_load(file)\n                    else:\n                        self.file_contents[file_path] = file.read()\n            except Exception as e:\n                self.errors.append(f\"Error reading {file_path}: {str(e)}\")\n\n    def execute(self):\n        self.list_files()\n        self.read_files()\n        return {\n            'file_list': self.file_list,\n            'file_contents': self.file_contents,\n            'errors': self.errors\n        }\n\n# Example usage\n# reader = FileSystemReader('/path/to/repository')\n# result = reader.execute()\n# print(result)\n```\n\nThis implementation provides a basic framework for interacting with the file system to read repository contents. It can be extended to include more sophisticated parsing and error handling as needed."
