  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during the import in `main.py`. This is a common issue in Python applications and typically stems from one of the following root causes:\n1. **Missing Dependency**: The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the current Python environment.\n2. **Path Issue**: The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect working directory or missing `__init__.py`).\n3. **Version Mismatch**: The installed version of `dexter_brain` is incompatible or corrupted.\n4. **Environment Configuration**: The virtual environment or interpreter settings are misconfigured.\n\nGiven the context (startup error, no prior context), the most likely cause is that the `dexter_brain` package was never installed or was removed accidentally. The stack trace points to a direct import failure, ruling out transitive dependencies or runtime issues.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Install the missing package using pip, ideally from a known source (e.g., PyPI, a private repository, or a local wheel).\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure the dependency is explicitly declared in a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` file and manage environments with a tool like `pipenv` or `poetry` to avoid version drift.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement dependency checks during CI/CD pipelines and use virtual environments consistently. Add health checks that validate critical imports before startup.\n4. **Risk Assessment**: The fix is low-risk as it only adds a missing dependency without modifying existing code.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate Action (Run these commands):**\n```bash\n# Assuming dexter_brain is available on PyPI or a private index\npip install dexter_brain\n\n# If it's a local module, ensure it's in the Python path or install it in editable mode\npip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain\n```\n\n**Permanent Fix:**\n1. Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt`:\n   ```txt\n   dexter_brain==1.0.0  # Specify a version if known\n   ```\n2. Use a virtual environment and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n3. Update the startup script to activate the virtual environment automatically.\n\n**Prevention:**\n- Add a pre-startup check in `main.py`:\n  ```python\n  try:\n      import dexter_brain\n  except ImportError:\n      logging.critical(\"Missing required dependency: dexter_brain\")\n      sys.exit(1)\n  ```\n- Integrate dependency checks in CI/CD:\n  ```yaml\n  # Example GitHub Actions step\n  - name: Check dependencies\n    run: pip check\n  ```\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH"
