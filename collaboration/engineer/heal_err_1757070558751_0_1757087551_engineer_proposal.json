  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during the startup of the application. This is a critical startup error, likely caused by one of the following root causes:\n1. The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the current Python environment.\n2. The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect working directory or missing `__init__.py`).\n3. There may be a version mismatch or dependency issue (e.g., the package was installed but corrupted or not compatible with the current environment).\n4. The codebase might have been moved or restructured without updating the import paths or environment configuration.\n\nGiven the context (startup error, no prior context available), the most probable cause is that the required package is missing from the environment, possibly due to a recent deployment, environment reset, or incomplete dependency installation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing package if it exists in a repository, or check the codebase structure.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure robust dependency management through requirements.txt or a virtual environment setup, and validate the environment during deployment.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement pre-startup checks for critical dependencies and use CI/CD pipelines to catch missing dependencies early.\n4. **Risk Assessment**: The fixes are low-risk as they involve environment adjustments and dependency checks, which are non-disruptive if handled correctly.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate_Action**: \n- Check if `dexter_brain` is a known internal package. If it is, ensure it is installed. Run:\n  ```bash\n  pip install dexter_brain   # if it is available on PyPI or an internal index\n  ```\n- If it is a local module, verify the project structure. The directory containing `dexter_brain` should be in the Python path. You can temporarily add it by modifying the startup script or setting `PYTHONPATH`:\n  ```bash\n  export PYTHONPATH=\"/path/to/directory/containing/dexter_brain:$PYTHONPATH\"\n  ```\n- Restart the application after taking the above step.\n\n**Permanent_Fix**:\n- Document and formalize dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file or use a tool like `pipenv` or `poetry` for dependency management.\n- In the startup script (`main.py`), add a pre-check to validate critical dependencies before proceeding:\n  ```python\n  try:\n      import dexter_brain\n  except ModuleNotFoundError:\n      logging.critical(\"Dependency 'dexter_brain' is missing. Please install it.\")\n      sys.exit(1)\n  ```\n- Automate dependency installation in your deployment process using:\n  ```bash\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  ```\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Integrate dependency checks into your CI/CD pipeline. For example, in a GitHub Action:\n  ```yaml\n  - name: Check dependencies\n    run: |\n      python -c \"import dexter_brain\" || exit 1\n  ```\n- Set up monitoring/alerting for missing modules in logs (e.g., using log aggregation tools to trigger alerts on `ModuleNotFoundError`).\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH\n\nThis solution is straightforward, minimally invasive, and addresses the root cause directly. It ensures the environment is correctly set up and prevents future occurrences through automation and checks."
