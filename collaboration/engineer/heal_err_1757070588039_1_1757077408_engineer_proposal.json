  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`, specifically when attempting to import `from dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox` during system startup. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package in the current environment. Possible root causes include:\n- The package is not installed in the environment.\n- The package is installed but not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect virtual environment, missing `__init__.py`, or path issues).\n- The package name is misspelled or has been renamed.\n- The module is part of a dependency that wasn’t included in the project setup (e.g., missing in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`).\n\nGiven the context (startup error, no prior context available), the most likely cause is that the `dexter_brain` package is missing from the environment, possibly due to an incomplete deployment or dependency installation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing package if it exists, or check for typo/renaming issues.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure the package is properly defined and included in the project’s dependency management (e.g., `requirements.txt`).\n3. **Prevention**: Implement pre-startup checks and use dependency management tools to avoid missing modules.\n4. **Risk Assessment**: The solution is low-risk as it involves environment checks and dependency installation, which are non-disruptive if done correctly.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate_Action**: \n- Check if `dexter_brain` is installed by running `pip list | grep dexter_brain` (Unix) or `pip list | findstr dexter_brain` (Windows). If not found, install it via `pip install dexter_brain` (if it’s a public package) or from a local path/private repository.\n- If the package is not publicly available, check the project structure for a local `dexter_brain` directory and ensure it is in the Python path (e.g., by adding it to `sys.path` or using `PYTHONPATH`).\n- Verify the import statement for typos (e.g., `dexter_brain` vs `dexter_brain`).\n\n**Permanent_Fix**:\n- Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` to ensure it is installed during deployment.\n- If it’s a local module, ensure it is packaged correctly (e.g., with `__init__.py` files) and included in the build process.\n- Use a virtual environment and dependency lock files (e.g., `pip freeze > requirements.txt`) to maintain consistency.\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Add a pre-startup validation script that checks for all required modules and logs/fails early if any are missing.\n- Implement CI/CD checks to validate dependencies before deployment.\n- Use tools like `pip check` to verify dependency consistency.\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH (standard Python dependency issue with straightforward resolution)\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (if needed for pre-startup check)\nIf a new skill is required to implement a pre-startup dependency validator, here’s a simple Python function to check for modules:\n\n```python\ndef check_dependencies(required_modules):\n    missing_modules = []\n    for module in required_modules:\n        try:\n            __import__(module)\n        except ImportError:\n            missing_modules.append(module)\n    if missing_modules:\n        raise ImportError(f\"Missing required modules: {missing_modules}\")\n    return True\n\n# Usage in startup_event (before main imports):\nrequired = ['dexter_brain', 'other_critical_package']\ncheck_dependencies(required)\n```\n\nThis can be integrated into `main.py` before the problematic import to catch issues early."
