  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`, specifically when attempting to import `create_sandbox` from `dexter_brain.sandbox` during system startup. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package in the current environment. The root cause is likely one of the following:\n- The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the environment.\n- The package is installed but not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect virtual environment, misconfigured PYTHONPATH).\n- There is a version mismatch or corruption in the package installation.\n- The import statement in the code is incorrect (e.g., typo, wrong module structure).\n\nGiven the context (startup error, critical severity), the most probable cause is a missing or improperly configured dependency.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing package if it exists, or check the codebase for the correct module structure.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure dependency management is robust, using a virtual environment and a requirements.txt or similar dependency file.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks during deployment or startup to validate all dependencies are available and correctly configured.\n4. **Risk Assessment**: The proposed solutions are low-risk as they involve standard dependency management practices.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate Action**:\n- Check if `dexter_brain` is installed by running `pip list | grep dexter_brain` (Unix) or `pip list | findstr dexter_brain` (Windows). If not found, install it via `pip install dexter_brain` (if it is a public package) or from the local source.\n- If the package is local, ensure the source directory is in the Python path. You can temporarily add it by modifying `sys.path` in `main.py` before the import:\n  ```python\n  import sys\n  sys.path.append('/path/to/dexter_brain_parent_directory')\n  ```\n- Validate the module structure: Ensure `dexter_brain/sandbox.py` exists and contains `create_sandbox`.\n\n**Permanent Fix**:\n- Use a virtual environment (e.g., `venv`) and a `requirements.txt` file to manage dependencies. Example:\n  ```bash\n  python -m venv venv\n  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  ```\n- Include `dexter_brain` in `requirements.txt` (with the correct version if applicable).\n- If `dexter_brain` is a local package, consider packaging it properly and installing it in editable mode:\n  ```bash\n  pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain\n  ```\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Add a pre-startup check in `main.py` to validate critical dependencies:\n  ```python\n  def check_dependencies():\n      try:\n          import dexter_brain\n      except ImportError:\n          raise RuntimeError(\"Missing dependency: dexter_brain. Please install it.\")\n  ```\n- Use CI/CD pipelines to run dependency checks before deployment.\n- Monitor system logs for `ModuleNotFoundError` and set up alerts.\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH\n\nThis approach addresses the immediate issue with minimal disruption and establishes best practices for long-term stability."
