  "content": "### Analysis\nThe `HEALING_TIMEOUT` error indicates that the error_healer subsystem itself is failing to resolve another error within its expected timeframe. This suggests a recursive or cascading failure scenario where the healing mechanism is becoming overwhelmed. Given the context:\n- High recent error count (1000) suggests system stress\n- 13 related healing timeout errors indicate this isn't isolated\n- The source being error_healer itself points to resource exhaustion or infinite healing loops\n\nRoot cause appears to be either:\n1. Resource starvation (CPU/memory) preventing timely error resolution\n2. Circular dependency in error healing logic\n3. Unbounded retry mechanism without proper backoff\n\n### Approach\nImplement a three-phase solution:\n1. Immediate: Break the healing loop and prevent system collapse\n2. Intermediate: Add circuit breakers and resource monitoring\n3. Long-term: Implement smarter healing with prioritization and backoff\n\n### Implementation\n\n**Immediate Action (Execute NOW):**\n```bash\n# Temporarily disable aggressive healing for timeout errors\ncurl -X POST http://error-healer-service/config/update \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"timeout_errors\": {\n      \"max_attempts\": 1,\n      \"retry_delay\": 30000,\n      \"circuit_breaker\": true\n    }\n  }'\n```\n\n**Permanent Fix:**\n```python\n# Enhanced healing service with circuit breaking\nclass SmartHealingService:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.circuit_breakers = {}\n        self.healing_priority = {\n            'CRITICAL': 0,\n            'HIGH': 1,\n            'MEDIUM': 2,\n            'LOW': 3,\n            'HEALING_TIMEOUT': 4  # Lowest priority\n        }\n    \n    async def heal_error(self, error_id):\n        if self._should_block_healing(error_id):\n            raise CircuitBreakerOpenError(f\"Healing blocked for {error_id}\")\n        \n        # Implement exponential backoff\n        delay = self._calculate_backoff(error_id)\n        await asyncio.sleep(delay)\n        \n        # Proceed with healing logic\n        return await self._execute_healing(error_id)\n```\n\n**Prevention:**\n- Add healing service metrics (success rate, latency, queue depth)\n- Implement alert when healing timeout rate exceeds 5%\n- Add resource utilization monitoring with auto-scaling triggers\n- Create healing dependency graph to detect circular dependencies\n\n**Risk_Level:** MEDIUM (Temporary reduction in healing coverage)\n**Confidence:** HIGH (Circuit breakers are proven pattern for cascading failures)\n\nThe solution prioritizes system stability over complete error resolution during high-load scenarios, preventing the healing system from becoming part of the problem it's trying to solve."
