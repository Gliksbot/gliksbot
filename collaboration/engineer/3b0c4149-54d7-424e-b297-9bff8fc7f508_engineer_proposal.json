This is a common text processing task that involves reading file content, splitting text into words, and counting occurrences. The solution should handle basic edge cases like punctuation and varying whitespace.\n\n**Approach**\nI'll create a Python script that:\n1. Takes a file path as input\n2. Reads the file content\n3. Splits the content into words using appropriate delimiters\n4. Counts the words\n5. Returns/prints the result\n\nThe script will handle:\n- Different whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines)\n- Basic punctuation (using string translation)\n- Empty files gracefully\n- File not found errors\n\n**Implementation**\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport string\n\ndef count_words_in_file(file_path):\n    try:\n        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:\n            content = file.read()\n            \n        # Create translation table to remove punctuation\n        translator = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)\n        cleaned_content = content.translate(translator)\n        \n        # Split into words and filter out empty strings\n        words = [word for word in cleaned_content.split() if word]\n        \n        return len(words)\n        \n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"Error: File '{file_path}' not found.\")\n        return 0\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error reading file: {e}\")\n        return 0\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    if len(sys.argv) != 2:\n        print(\"Usage: python wordcount.py <file_path>\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n    \n    file_path = sys.argv[1]\n    word_count = count_words_in_file(file_path)\n    print(f\"Word count: {word_count}\")\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n```bash\npython wordcount.py sample.txt\n```\n\nThe script handles punctuation by removing it before counting, ensuring accurate word boundaries. It's robust against common file reading issues and provides clear error messages."
