  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during the startup of the application. This typically occurs due to one of the following reasons:\n- The module is not installed in the current Python environment.\n- The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect directory structure or missing `__init__.py`).\n- There is a version mismatch or dependency issue.\n- The module was renamed, moved, or deleted.\n\nGiven the stack trace points to `line 120` in `main.py` attempting to import from `dexter_brain.sandbox`, it is likely that the `dexter_brain` package is either missing from the environment or improperly configured.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Verify Environment and Dependencies**: Check if the `dexter_brain` module is listed in the project's dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`) and ensure it is installed.\n2. **Check Python Path and Module Structure**: Ensure the module directory exists and is accessible, with proper `__init__.py` files if it's a package.\n3. **Reinstall Dependencies**: Reinstall the dependencies to ensure all modules are present.\n4. **Add Fallback or Validation**: Implement checks during startup to validate critical dependencies before proceeding.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate Action**:\n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is installed by running:\n   ```bash\n   pip list | grep dexter_brain\n   ```\n   If not found, install it via:\n   ```bash\n   pip install dexter_brain  # or use a specific version if required\n   ```\n2. If the module is custom/local, ensure the directory containing `dexter_brain` is in the Python path. You can temporarily add it in `main.py` before the import:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   sys.path.append('/path/to/dexter_brain_parent_directory')\n   ```\n3. Restart the application.\n\n**Permanent Fix**:\n1. Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` (if it's a external package) or ensure the local module is properly packaged.\n2. Use a virtual environment to manage dependencies consistently.\n3. Implement a dependency check at startup:\n   ```python\n   try:\n       import dexter_brain\n   except ModuleNotFoundError:\n       logging.critical(\"Dependency 'dexter_brain' is missing. Install it and restart.\")\n       sys.exit(1)\n   ```\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Use a dependency management tool (e.g., `pipenv`, `poetry`) to lock versions.\n- Add pre-startup checks in CI/CD pipelines to validate dependencies.\n- Monitor and alert on missing dependencies in logs.\n\n**Risk Level**: LOW (dependency installation and path adjustments are low-risk if done correctly).  \n**Confidence**: HIGH (this is a common issue with straightforward solutions).\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (if needed)\nNo new skill is required; this involves standard Python dependency troubleshooting and environment management."
