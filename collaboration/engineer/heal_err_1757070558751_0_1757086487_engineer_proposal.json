  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`, specifically when attempting to import `create_sandbox` from `dexter_brain.sandbox` during system startup. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package in the current environment. Potential root causes include:\n- The package is not installed in the environment.\n- The package is installed but not on the Python path (e.g., incorrect virtual environment, misconfigured PYTHONPATH).\n- The package exists but is corrupted or incomplete.\n- The import statement has a typo or incorrect module structure (though the stack trace suggests the module is expected).\n\nGiven the context (startup error, no prior context), the most likely cause is a missing installation of the `dexter_brain` package, possibly due to a deployment issue, incomplete dependency setup, or environment misconfiguration.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing package if it exists in a repository.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure robust dependency management (e.g., using `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`) and automate environment setup.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks during deployment/startup to validate all dependencies are present, and set up monitoring for missing modules.\n4. **Risk Assessment**: Installing a package is low risk if done correctly, but care must be taken to use the correct version to avoid compatibility issues.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate_Action**: \n- Check if `dexter_brain` is available in your package registry (e.g., PyPI, private repo). If yes, install it with pip:\n  ```bash\n  pip install dexter_brain\n  ```\n  If it's a local package, ensure it is installed in editable mode or added to the path.\n- Verify the installation:\n  ```bash\n  python -c \"import dexter_brain; print('Module found')\"\n  ```\n- Restart the application.\n\n**Permanent_Fix**:\n- Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` or equivalent dependency file.\n- Use a virtual environment and automate dependency installation during deployment (e.g., via CI/CD scripts).\n- Example `requirements.txt` entry:\n  ```\n  dexter_brain==1.0.0  # specify version if known\n  ```\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Add a pre-startup check in `main.py` to validate critical imports:\n  ```python\n  def check_dependencies():\n      required_modules = ['dexter_brain']\n      for module in required_modules:\n          try:\n              __import__(module)\n          except ImportError:\n              raise RuntimeError(f\"Missing required module: {module}\")\n  ```\n  Call this function before attempting other imports.\n- Set up alerts for `ModuleNotFoundError` in logs.\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW (if package is trusted and versioned correctly)  \n**Confidence**: HIGH (standard dependency resolution)"
