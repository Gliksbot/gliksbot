  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during the import in `main.py`. This is a common issue in Python applications and typically arises due to one of the following root causes:\n1. The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the current Python environment.\n2. The package is installed but not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect virtual environment, wrong PYTHONPATH).\n3. The module exists but has not been properly packaged or is missing dependencies.\n4. There might be a version mismatch or a broken installation.\n\nGiven the context (startup error in a backend system), it is likely that the deployment or environment setup is incomplete or misconfigured.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing package if it exists in a repository.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure proper dependency management and environment isolation (e.g., using virtual environments and requirements.txt).\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks in the deployment pipeline to validate all dependencies before startup.\n\n### Implementation\n\n#### Immediate_Action\n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is available in your project's dependencies or a private package index.\n   - If it is a local module, ensure the path is correct. You might need to adjust `sys.path` or the package structure.\n   - If it is an external package, install it via pip:  \n     ```bash\n     pip install dexter_brain\n     ```\n   - If it is a local package, install it in editable mode (if set up with setup.py):  \n     ```bash\n     pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain\n     ```\n2. Restart the application to see if the error resolves.\n\n#### Permanent_Fix\n1. Use a `requirements.txt` file or `pyproject.toml` to declare all dependencies.\n2. Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n3. If `dexter_brain` is a local module, ensure it is properly packaged and included in the installation.\n\nExample `requirements.txt`:\n```\n# If dexter_brain is external\ndexter_brain==1.0.0\n# Or if local, use editable install\n-e ./lib/dexter_brain\n```\n\n#### Prevention\n1. Add a pre-startup check in `main.py` to validate critical imports:\n   ```python\n   def check_imports():\n       required_modules = ['dexter_brain']\n       for module in required_modules:\n           try:\n               __import__(module)\n           except ImportError:\n               raise RuntimeError(f\"Required module {module} is not installed.\")\n   ```\n2. Integrate dependency checks in your CI/CD pipeline to ensure all dependencies are met before deployment.\n\n#### Risk_Level: LOW\nThe proposed solution involves standard Python dependency management practices and poses minimal risk if implemented correctly.\n\n#### Confidence: HIGH\nThis is a well-understood issue in Python development, and the solutions are proven and widely used."
