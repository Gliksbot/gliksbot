  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` is a critical startup failure indicating that the Python module `dexter_brain` is missing from the environment where the application is running. This typically occurs due to:\n- The module not being installed in the current Python environment.\n- A mismatch between the environment used for development and production (e.g., missing dependencies in `requirements.txt` or improper environment isolation).\n- The module not being properly packaged or deployed if this is a production system.\n\nGiven the stack trace points to `line 120` in `main.py` during a startup event, this is likely a deployment or environment configuration issue rather than a code logic error.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Mitigation**: Verify the environment and install the missing module if it exists, or check for typographical errors in the import statement.\n2. **Root Cause Resolution**: Ensure dependency management is robust, using virtual environments and pinned requirements.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks during deployment or startup to validate all dependencies are available before proceeding.\n\n### Implementation\n#### Immediate_Action:\n1. **Check the current environment**: \n   - Run `pip list` or `conda list` to see if `dexter_brain` is installed.\n   - If not, attempt to install it via `pip install dexter_brain` (if it is a public package) or from a private repository if applicable.\n2. **Validate the module path**: \n   - Ensure the module is correctly named and located. If it’s a local module, check that the directory structure matches the import statement (e.g., `dexter_brain/sandbox.py` should exist relative to the project root or Python path).\n3. **Restart the application** after resolving the dependency.\n\nIf the module is not available for installation, check the project’s `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` for missing entries and add them.\n\n#### Permanent_Fix:\n1. **Use a virtual environment** (e.g., venv, conda) to isolate dependencies.\n2. **Maintain a `requirements.txt`** with all dependencies explicitly listed. For example:\n   ```\n   dexter_brain==1.0.0  # or the appropriate version\n   ```\n3. **Automate dependency installation** during deployment using:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n4. **If `dexter_brain` is a local module**, ensure it is included in the deployment package (e.g., via `MANIFEST.in` for source distributions or proper inclusion in Docker builds).\n\n#### Prevention:\n1. **Add a pre-startup check** in `main.py` to validate critical dependencies:\n   ```python\n   def check_dependencies():\n       required_modules = ['dexter_brain']\n       for module in required_modules:\n           try:\n               __import__(module)\n           except ImportError:\n               raise RuntimeError(f\"Missing required module: {module}\")\n   \n   # Call this function before any other imports in startup_event\n   ```\n2. **Use CI/CD pipelines** to run tests in an environment mirroring production, ensuring dependencies are always correct.\n3. **Monitor and alert** on missing dependencies during deployment using exit codes or health checks.\n\n#### Risk_Level: LOW\n- The solution involves standard dependency management practices with minimal disruption.\n- Installing missing modules or adjusting environment configuration is low-risk if done correctly.\n\n#### Confidence: HIGH\n- This is a common issue with well-established solutions in Python development.\n- The steps are straightforward and have been proven effective in similar scenarios.\n\n### Collaboration Note:\nIf the team confirms `dexter_brain` is a custom module, ensure it is properly packaged and deployed. If it is a third-party module, verify the repository URL or PyPI availability."
