  "content": "### Analysis\nThe `HEALING_TIMEOUT` error indicates that the error_healer subsystem is failing to complete error resolution within its expected timeframe. Given the context:\n- This is occurring within the error_healer system itself (source: error_healer)\n- There are 54 similar timeout errors in recent history\n- System shows elevated error counts (119 recent errors, 2 critical)\n\nRoot cause appears to be either:\n1. **Resource exhaustion** - The error_healer is overwhelmed by the volume of errors (119 recent errors)\n2. **Infinite healing loops** - The system may be stuck in recursive healing attempts\n3. **Blocking operations** - Synchronous operations preventing timely completion\n4. **Dependency failures** - External services required for healing are unresponsive\n\n### Approach\nImplement a multi-phase solution focusing on immediate stabilization followed by architectural improvements:\n\n1. **Immediate**: Implement circuit breakers and timeouts to prevent cascading failures\n2. **Short-term**: Add monitoring and logging to identify specific bottlenecks  \n3. **Long-term**: Refactor healing system to use asynchronous, non-blocking patterns\n\n### Implementation\n\n**Immediate Action (5-15 minutes):**\n```python\n# Add to error_healer configuration\nHEALING_TIMEOUT = 30000  # Reduce from current timeout\nMAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 2   # Reduce from 3\nCIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD = 5  # Fail fast after 5 consecutive timeouts\n\n# Implement in healing logic\ndef with_circuit_breaker(func):\n    failures = 0\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        nonlocal failures\n        if failures >= CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD:\n            raise CircuitBreakerOpenError(\"Healing suspended - too many failures\")\n        try:\n            result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n            failures = 0\n            return result\n        except TimeoutError:\n            failures += 1\n            raise\n    return wrapper\n```\n\n**Permanent Fix:**\n```python\n# Transition to async healing architecture\nasync def heal_error_async(error_id):\n    try:\n        async with async_timeout.timeout(HEALING_TIMEOUT):\n            # Break healing into non-blocking stages\n            diagnosis = await diagnose_async(error_id)\n            solution = await generate_solution_async(diagnosis)\n            await apply_solution_async(solution)\n            return await verify_healing_async(error_id)\n    except asyncio.TimeoutError:\n        await queue_for_retry(error_id)\n        raise HealingTimeoutError(f\"Healing timed out for {error_id}\")\n```\n\n**Prevention:**\n- Implement healing performance metrics (95th percentile healing time)\n- Set up alerts for healing queue depth > 50\n- Add distributed tracing to identify slow healing stages\n- Create fallback mechanisms for dependency failures\n\n**Risk_Level:** MEDIUM (circuit breakers may temporarily suspend healing for legitimate errors)\n**Confidence:** HIGH (timeout management and async patterns are proven solutions for this class of issues)"
