  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates a missing Python module dependency. This is a common issue in Python applications where required packages are not installed in the environment. The root cause is likely one of:\n1. The `dexter_brain` package was never installed in the current environment\n2. The environment was reset/changed without reinstalling dependencies\n3. There's a version conflict or broken installation\n4. The module path has changed but imports weren't updated\n\nGiven this is a startup error with no context available, the most probable cause is missing dependencies in the deployment environment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate mitigation**: Install the missing package or check environment configuration\n2. **Permanent fix**: Implement proper dependency management and environment validation\n3. **Prevention**: Add pre-startup checks and better error handling\n4. **Risk assessment**: Low risk for dependency installation, medium for structural changes\n\n### Implementation\n\n**Immediate_Action**: \n```bash\n# Check if dexter_brain exists in pip registry\npip search dexter_brain\n\n# Install the package (if available via pip)\npip install dexter_brain\n\n# If it's a local package, install from source\npip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain\n\n# Alternatively, check requirements.txt and install all dependencies\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n**Permanent_Fix**:\n1. Create/update `requirements.txt` with all dependencies:\n```\ndexter_brain==1.0.0  # or appropriate version\n# other dependencies\n```\n\n2. Implement environment validation in startup script:\n```python\n# Add to main.py before imports\ndef check_dependencies():\n    required_packages = ['dexter_brain', 'other_critical_packages']\n    missing = []\n    for package in required_packages:\n        try:\n            __import__(package)\n        except ImportError:\n            missing.append(package)\n    \n    if missing:\n        raise ImportError(f\"Missing required packages: {missing}\")\n\n# Call this function early in startup\ncheck_dependencies()\n```\n\n**Prevention**:\n1. Add pre-flight checks in CI/CD pipeline\n2. Implement health checks that validate all dependencies\n3. Use virtual environments with locked dependency versions\n4. Add better error messaging for missing dependencies\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH\n\nThe solution is low-risk because:\n1. Dependency installation is reversible\n2. Environment validation adds minimal overhead\n3. The changes are defensive and non-breaking\n4. Better error messages improve debugging capability\n\nThis approach addresses the immediate issue while implementing structural improvements to prevent recurrence."
