  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package during the import in `main.py`. The root cause is likely one of the following:\n- The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the current Python environment.\n- The package is installed but not on the Python path (e.g., incorrect virtual environment, missing `__init__.py`, or incorrect directory structure).\n- There might be a typo or case sensitivity issue in the module name.\n- The package might be part of a larger project that hasn't been properly set up or deployed.\n\nGiven the context (startup error, critical severity, and no additional context), the most probable cause is a missing installation or environment misconfiguration.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing package if it exists, or check the project structure.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure the package is properly packaged, installed, and managed via dependency management (e.g., `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`).\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks during deployment or startup to validate all dependencies are available, and use CI/CD to catch missing dependencies early.\n\n### Implementation\n\n#### Immediate_Action:\n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is installed:\n   ```bash\n   pip list | grep dexter_brain\n   ```\n   If not found, install it (if it's a known package):\n   ```bash\n   pip install dexter_brain\n   ```\n   If it's a local package, ensure it's installed in editable mode or the path is correct.\n\n2. Verify the Python path and environment:\n   - Confirm the correct virtual environment is activated.\n   - Check if the package directory exists and has `__init__.py`.\n\n3. If the package is local, navigate to its parent directory and install it:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -e .\n   ```\n\n#### Permanent_Fix:\n1. Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`:\n   ```txt\n   # requirements.txt\n   dexter_brain>=1.0.0  # or use a local path if internal\n   ```\n2. Use a virtual environment and ensure dependencies are installed during deployment:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n3. If `dexter_brain` is an internal module, structure it as a proper Python package and distribute it via a private repository or include it in the project.\n\n#### Prevention:\n1. Add a dependency check at startup:\n   ```python\n   try:\n       import dexter_brain\n   except ImportError:\n       logging.critical(\"Missing dexter_brain module. Please install dependencies.\")\n       sys.exit(1)\n   ```\n2. Use CI/CD to run tests in an environment that mirrors production, ensuring all dependencies are resolved.\n3. Implement logging and alerts for missing modules during deployment.\n\n#### Risk_Level: LOW\nThe solution involves standard dependency management practices with minimal risk.\n\n#### Confidence: HIGH\nThis is a common issue with well-established solutions in Python environments.\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (if needed):\nNot required for this solution, as it uses basic Python environment management."
