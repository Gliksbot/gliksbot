  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`, specifically when attempting to import `create_sandbox` from `dexter_brain.sandbox` during system startup. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package in the current environment. Possible root causes include:\n- The package is not installed in the environment.\n- The package is installed but not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect virtual environment, misconfigured `PYTHONPATH`).\n- The package exists but is corrupted or incomplete.\n- There is a version mismatch or dependency issue.\n\nGiven the context (startup error, critical severity, and no prior context), the most likely cause is that the `dexter_brain` package is missing from the deployment environment or the virtual environment is not activated properly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing package if necessary.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure the package is properly included in the deployment process (e.g., via requirements.txt, setup.py, or Docker image).\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks during deployment or startup to validate all dependencies are present.\n4. **Risk Assessment**: The proposed solution is low-risk as it involves standard dependency management.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate_Action**: \n- SSH into the server or access the deployment environment.\n- Activate the virtual environment (if used): `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux) or `venv\\Scripts\\activate` (Windows).\n- Check if `dexter_brain` is installed: `pip list | grep dexter_brain` or `pip show dexter_brain`.\n- If not installed, install it: `pip install dexter_brain` (if available on PyPI) or `pip install /path/to/local/package` (if local).\n- Restart the application.\n\n**Permanent_Fix**:\n- Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` to ensure it is installed during deployment.\n- If it's a custom package, ensure it is built and distributed correctly (e.g., using `setuptools`).\n- Use a containerized approach (Docker) to bundle all dependencies consistently.\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Add a pre-startup check in `main.py` to validate critical dependencies:\n  ```python\n  try:\n      import dexter_brain\n  except ImportError:\n      logging.critical(\"Missing dexter_brain package. Please install it.\")\n      sys.exit(1)\n  ```\n- Implement CI/CD checks to verify all dependencies are included in the build.\n- Use dependency management tools like `pipenv` or `poetry` for better environment consistency.\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH\n\nThis solution is straightforward, minimally invasive, and addresses the core issue without disrupting ongoing operations."
