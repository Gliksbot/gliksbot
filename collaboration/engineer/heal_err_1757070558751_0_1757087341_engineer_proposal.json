  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during the import in `main.py`. This is a common issue in Python applications and typically stems from one of the following root causes:\n- The module is not installed in the current Python environment.\n- The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect directory structure or missing `__init__.py`).\n- There is a version mismatch or dependency issue (e.g., the module was renamed or removed).\n- The environment (virtual environment, system PATH) is misconfigured.\n\nGiven the context (startup error, critical severity, and no prior context), the most likely cause is that the `dexter_brain` package is missing from the environment where the application is running. This could be due to a recent deployment, environment reset, or incomplete dependency installation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing module if it exists in a repository (e.g., PyPI or a private index). If not, check the source code for the module's location.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure the dependency is explicitly declared in a requirements file (e.g., `requirements.txt`) and that the deployment process includes a step to install all dependencies.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks in the CI/CD pipeline to validate dependencies before deployment, and use virtual environments to isolate dependencies.\n4. **Risk Assessment**: The fixes are low-risk as they involve dependency management and environment validationâ€”common practices in Python development.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate Action Steps**:\n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is available in PyPI or a private package index:\n   ```bash\n   pip search dexter_brain\n   ```\n   If it is, install it:\n   ```bash\n   pip install dexter_brain\n   ```\n2. If it is not available publicly, look for it in the project's source code (e.g., in a `lib/` or `src/` directory). If found, ensure the directory is in the Python path or install it locally:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain\n   ```\n3. Restart the application.\n\n**Permanent Fix**:\n- Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` (with a specific version if possible):\n  ```\n  dexter_brain==1.0.0  # or use a git URL if private\n  ```\n- Update the deployment script to install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:\n  ```bash\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  ```\n- Use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with system packages.\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Add a pre-startup check in `main.py` to validate critical dependencies:\n  ```python\n  try:\n      import dexter_brain\n  except ImportError:\n      logging.critical(\"Missing dexter_brain module. Please install dependencies.\")\n      sys.exit(1)\n  ```\n- Integrate dependency checks in CI/CD (e.g., run `pip check` or a dry-run install).\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH\n\nThis solution is straightforward, minimally invasive, and follows Python best practices for dependency management."
