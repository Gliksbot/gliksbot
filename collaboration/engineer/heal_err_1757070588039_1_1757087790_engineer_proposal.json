  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`, specifically when attempting to import `create_sandbox` from `dexter_brain.sandbox`. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package in the current environment. Possible root causes include:\n- The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the environment.\n- The package is installed but not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect virtual environment, misconfigured `PYTHONPATH`).\n- The package name or module structure has changed (e.g., renamed or moved).\n- The installation of `dexter_brain` failed or is corrupted.\n\nGiven the context (startup error, no prior context available), the most likely cause is a missing installation of the `dexter_brain` package.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Install the missing package or verify its presence in the environment.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure the package is properly documented as a dependency and included in the project's environment setup (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, or `setup.py`).\n3. **Prevention**: Implement dependency management and environment validation checks during startup or in CI/CD pipelines.\n4. **Risk Assessment**: The solution is low-risk as it involves standard dependency management practices.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate_Action**: \nRun the following command in the environment where the application is hosted (e.g., terminal, CI/CD environment):\n```bash\npip install dexter_brain\n```\nIf the package is not available on PyPI, install it from the source (e.g., Git repository or local path):\n```bash\npip install git+https://github.com/<org>/dexter_brain.git  # Replace with actual URL\n```\nOr if itâ€™s a local package:\n```bash\npip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain\n```\n\n**Permanent_Fix**:\nAdd `dexter_brain` to the project's dependency file (e.g., `requirements.txt`):\n```\ndexter_brain==1.0.0  # Specify the correct version\n```\nOr in `pyproject.toml` (if using Poetry or similar):\n```toml\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\ndexter_brain = \"^1.0.0\"\n```\nEnsure the environment is rebuilt/reinstalled after updating dependencies.\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Add a pre-startup check in `main.py` to validate critical dependencies:\n```python\ndef check_dependencies():\n    required_modules = ['dexter_brain']\n    for module in required_modules:\n        try:\n            __import__(module)\n        except ImportError:\n            raise RuntimeError(f\"Missing required module: {module}. Please install it.\")\n```\nCall this function before the startup event.\n- Integrate dependency checks in CI/CD pipelines (e.g., run `pip check` or validate imports in tests).\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH\n\nThis solution is straightforward, minimally invasive, and addresses the core issue of a missing dependency."
