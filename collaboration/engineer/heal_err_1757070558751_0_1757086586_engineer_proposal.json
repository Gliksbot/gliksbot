  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during the import in `main.py` at line 120. This typically occurs due to:\n- The module not being installed in the current Python environment.\n- The module not being available in the Python path (e.g., incorrect working directory or missing `__init__.py`).\n- A version mismatch or incomplete installation of dependencies.\n- The module might be part of a larger package that hasn't been properly set up or deployed.\n\nGiven the context of a startup error in a backend system (`gliksbot/backend`), it is likely that the deployment or environment setup is missing this critical module.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Mitigation**: Verify the environment and install missing dependencies.\n2. **Root Cause Resolution**: Ensure the module is properly included in the project structure or installed via a package manager.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement dependency management and environment checks during startup.\n\n### Implementation\n\n#### Immediate_Action:\n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is listed in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`. If not, add it and run:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n2. If `dexter_brain` is a local module, ensure the project structure includes it and the working directory is correct. For example:\n   ```\n   M:\\gliksbot\\\n   ├── backend/\n   │   ├── main.py\n   │   └── dexter_brain/   # Ensure this directory exists\n   │       ├── __init__.py\n   │       └── sandbox.py\n   ```\n3. Temporarily add the path to `sys.path` in `main.py` before the import (as a quick fix):\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   sys.path.insert(0, 'M:/gliksbot/backend')  # Adjust path as needed\n   from dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox\n   ```\n\n#### Permanent_Fix:\n1. Package `dexter_brain` as a installable module (if it's local) by creating a `setup.py`:\n   ```python\n   from setuptools import setup, find_packages\n   setup(name='dexter_brain', packages=find_packages())\n   ```\n   Install it in development mode:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -e .\n   ```\n2. Use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and ensure consistency across deployments.\n\n#### Prevention:\n1. Add environment validation at startup:\n   ```python\n   try:\n       import dexter_brain\n   except ModuleNotFoundError:\n       logging.critical(\"Missing dexter_brain module. Check dependencies.\")\n       sys.exit(1)\n   ```\n2. Implement CI/CD checks to validate all dependencies are installed before deployment.\n3. Use Docker to containerize the application with all dependencies pre-installed.\n\n#### Risk_Level: LOW\nThe solutions involve standard dependency management and path adjustments, which are low-risk if implemented correctly.\n\n#### Confidence: HIGH\nThis is a common Python deployment issue with well-established solutions.\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (if needed)\nNo new skills required; this involves basic Python dependency and environment management."
