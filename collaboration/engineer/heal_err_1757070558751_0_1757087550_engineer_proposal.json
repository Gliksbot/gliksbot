  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during the import process in `main.py`. This is a common issue in Python applications and typically stems from one of the following root causes:\n1. The module is not installed in the current Python environment.\n2. The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect directory structure or missing `__init__.py` files).\n3. There is a version mismatch or the module was not included in the deployment (if applicable).\n4. The module name has a typo or was renamed.\n\nGiven the context (startup error, critical severity), it is likely that the deployment or environment setup is incomplete or misconfigured. The absence of context suggests this might be a fresh deployment or an environment that hasn't been fully provisioned.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing module if it exists in a repository, or check the file structure.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure the module is properly packaged and deployed, or adjust the Python path if the module is in a non-standard location.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks in the startup process to validate all dependencies before attempting to import them. Use virtual environments and requirement files for consistency.\n4. **Risk Assessment**: The fixes are low-risk as they involve environment adjustments or dependency installation, which are reversible.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate_Action**:\n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is listed in `requirements.txt` or `setup.py`. If not, add it and run:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n2. If the module is local, ensure the directory containing `dexter_brain` is in the Python path. You can temporarily modify `sys.path` in `main.py`:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/dexter_brain_parent_directory')\n   ```\n3. Verify the directory structure. It should look like:\n   ```\n   project_root/\n   ├── dexter_brain/\n   │   ├── __init__.py\n   │   └── sandbox.py\n   └── main.py\n   ```\n\n**Permanent_Fix**:\n1. Package the module properly and ensure it is installed in the environment during deployment. Use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts.\n2. If the module is internal, consider distributing it as a package via a private PyPI or including it in the project structure with proper relative imports.\n\n**Prevention**:\n1. Add a pre-startup check script that validates all dependencies:\n   ```python\n   try:\n       import dexter_brain\n   except ModuleNotFoundError:\n       print(\"Error: dexter_brain not installed. Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'\")\n       sys.exit(1)\n   ```\n2. Use CI/CD pipelines to run dependency checks before deployment.\n3. Monitor the environment for changes and alert on missing dependencies.\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH\n\nThis solution is straightforward and addresses the common causes of ModuleNotFoundError. It minimizes disruption by focusing on environment and dependency management."
