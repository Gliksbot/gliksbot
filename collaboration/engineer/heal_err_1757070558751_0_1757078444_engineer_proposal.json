  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` is a Python import error indicating that the required `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the environment where the application is running. This is a common issue in Python applications, often caused by:\n- Missing dependency in the environment\n- Incorrect virtual environment activation\n- Package not included in requirements.txt\n- Path issues in the Python environment\n\nGiven this is a startup error with critical severity, it suggests the core functionality depends on this module, making the system completely non-functional until resolved.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate mitigation**: Install the missing package or verify environment configuration\n2. **Root cause investigation**: Check dependency management and deployment processes\n3. **Long-term solution**: Implement robust dependency management and validation\n4. **Prevention**: Add pre-startup dependency checks and monitoring\n\n### Implementation\n\n**Immediate Action:**\n```bash\n# Check if dexter_brain is available\npip list | grep dexter_brain\n\n# Install the missing package (if known package name)\npip install dexter_brain\n\n# Or install from requirements if available\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# Verify the installation\npython -c \"import dexter_brain; print('Module found')\"\n```\n\n**Permanent Fix:**\n1. Add dependency validation in startup sequence:\n```python\n# Add to main.py before attempting to import dexter_brain\ndef verify_dependencies():\n    required_packages = ['dexter_brain', 'other_critical_packages']\n    missing = []\n    for package in required_packages:\n        try:\n            __import__(package)\n        except ImportError:\n            missing.append(package)\n    \n    if missing:\n        raise RuntimeError(f\"Missing required packages: {missing}\")\n\n# Call this function before any imports\nverify_dependencies()\n```\n\n2. Ensure proper dependency management:\n- Maintain accurate requirements.txt\n- Use virtual environments\n- Implement containerization (Docker) for consistent environments\n\n**Prevention:**\n- Add pre-deployment dependency checks in CI/CD pipeline\n- Implement health checks that validate all required modules\n- Set up monitoring for missing dependency alerts\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- **Risk_Level**: LOW - Dependency installation is a standard operation\n- **Confidence**: HIGH - This is a well-understood Python environment issue\n\n**Skill Spec:**\n```python\n# SKILL_SPEC: Python Dependency Management\n# Description: Handles Python package installation, virtual environments, and dependency validation\n# Input: List of required packages, environment context\n# Output: Success/failure status with detailed error reporting\n\nclass DependencyManager:\n    def __init__(self, requirements_file='requirements.txt'):\n        self.requirements_file = requirements_file\n    \n    def verify_environment(self):\n        # Implementation for comprehensive environment validation\n        pass\n    \n    def install_missing_dependencies(self):\n        # Automated dependency installation with fallbacks\n        pass\n```\n\nThe solution focuses on immediate recovery while implementing safeguards to prevent recurrence through better dependency management practices."
