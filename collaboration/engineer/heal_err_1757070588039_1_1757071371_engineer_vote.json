  "content": "Analysis: The root cause of the error is the absence of the 'dexter_brain' module, which is required by the system during startup. This could be due to the module not being installed, a misconfiguration in the module path, or the module being removed or renamed.\n\nImmediate_Action: \n1. Verify the existence of the 'dexter_brain' module in the expected directory.\n2. If the module is missing, check the version control system to see if it was accidentally removed and restore it.\n3. If the module exists, ensure that the PYTHONPATH environment variable includes the directory containing 'dexter_brain'.\n4. Restart the system after making these changes to see if the issue is resolved.\n\nPermanent_Fix: \n1. Implement a dependency management system, such as using `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile`, to ensure all necessary modules are installed.\n2. Set up a continuous integration pipeline that checks for the presence of all required modules before deployment.\n3. Document the module dependencies and their installation process clearly in the project documentation.\n\nPrevention: \n1. Implement automated tests that check for the presence of all critical modules during the build process.\n2. Set up monitoring and alerting for module import errors in the production environment.\n3. Regularly review and update the dependency list to ensure all modules are accounted for.\n\nRisk_Level: LOW - The proposed solutions are standard practices for managing dependencies and should not disrupt ongoing operations.\n\nConfidence: HIGH - The steps outlined are based on common practices for resolving module import errors and managing dependencies effectively."
