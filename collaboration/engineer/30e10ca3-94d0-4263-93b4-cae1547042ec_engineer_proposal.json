The calculator should be able to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Error handling is crucial to manage potential issues such as division by zero, invalid input, and other runtime errors.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Functionality**: Implement a command-line calculator that can perform the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n   \n2. **User Input**: Accept user input for the operation and operands. This can be done using the `input()` function.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for:\n   - Division by zero.\n   - Invalid input (e.g., non-numeric input).\n   - Invalid operations (e.g., unsupported operations).\n\n4. **Loop for Continuous Operation**: Allow the user to perform multiple calculations until they decide to exit.\n\n5. **Output**: Display the result of the calculation or an appropriate error message.\n\n### Implementation\n\n```python\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    return x - y\n\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    return x * y\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n    if y == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n    return x / y\n\ndef calculator():\n    print(\"Simple Python Calculator\")\n    print(\"Operations: +, -, *, /\")\n    print(\"Type 'exit' to quit the calculator.\")\n    \n    while True:\n        try:\n            user_input = input(\"Enter operation (e.g., 2 + 2): \").strip()\n            if user_input.lower() == 'exit':\n                print(\"Exiting the calculator. Goodbye!\")\n                break\n            \n            # Split input into components\n            parts = user_input.split()\n            if len(parts) != 3:\n                raise ValueError(\"Invalid input format. Use: number operator number\")\n            \n            num1, operator, num2 = parts\n            num1 = float(num1)\n            num2 = float(num2)\n            \n            if operator == '+':\n                result = add(num1, num2)\n            elif operator == '-':\n                result = subtract(num1, num2)\n            elif operator == '*':\n                result = multiply(num1, num2)\n            elif operator == '/':\n                result = divide(num1, num2)\n            else:\n                raise ValueError(\"Unsupported operation. Use: +, -, *, /\")\n            \n            print(f\"Result: {result}\")\n        \n        except ValueError as ve:\n            print(f\"Error: {ve}\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"An unexpected error occurred: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculator()\n```\n\nThis implementation provides a simple command-line calculator with basic error handling. It guides the user through the process, handles common errors gracefully, and allows for continuous operation until the user decides to exit."
