  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`, specifically when attempting to import `create_sandbox` from `dexter_brain.sandbox`. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package in the current environment. Possible root causes include:\n- The package is not installed in the environment.\n- The package is installed but not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect virtual environment, misconfigured PYTHONPATH).\n- The package exists but is corrupted or incomplete.\n- There is a version mismatch or dependency issue.\n\nGiven the context (startup error, critical severity, and no additional context), the most likely cause is that the `dexter_brain` package is missing from the environment where the application is running.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Install the missing package or verify the environment setup.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure the environment is correctly managed with dependency tracking (e.g., using `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`).\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks during deployment or startup to validate all dependencies are present.\n4. **Risk Assessment**: The proposed solution is low-risk as it involves standard dependency management practices.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate_Action**: \nRun the following command in the environment (assuming `dexter_brain` is available via pip or a similar package manager):\n```bash\npip install dexter_brain\n```\nIf the package is not available on PyPI, you may need to install it from a local path or a private repository. For example:\n```bash\npip install /path/to/local/dexter_brain\n```\nOr if using a `requirements.txt` file:\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n**Permanent_Fix**:\n1. Maintain a `requirements.txt` file listing all dependencies, including `dexter_brain`.\n2. Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies. For example:\n```bash\npython -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n3. Consider using a tool like `pip-tools` or `poetry` for more robust dependency management.\n\n**Prevention**:\n1. Add a pre-startup check to verify all required modules are importable. For example, in `main.py`:\n```python\ndef check_dependencies():\n    required_modules = ['dexter_brain']\n    for module in required_modules:\n        try:\n            __import__(module)\n        except ImportError:\n            raise RuntimeError(f\"Missing required module: {module}\")\n\n# Call this function before attempting to use dexter_brain\ncheck_dependencies()\n```\n2. Integrate this check into your CI/CD pipeline to catch missing dependencies early.\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH\n\nThis solution is straightforward and addresses the core issue without disrupting ongoing operations. If `dexter_brain` is a custom package, ensure it is properly packaged and available in the environment."
