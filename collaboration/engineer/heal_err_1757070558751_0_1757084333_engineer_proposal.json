  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` is a critical startup failure indicating that the Python module `dexter_brain` is missing from the environment where the application is running. This typically occurs due to one of the following root causes:\n- The module was not installed in the current Python environment.\n- The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect working directory or environment configuration).\n- There might be a version mismatch or a broken installation.\n- The codebase might have been recently updated, and dependencies were not synchronized.\n\nGiven the stack trace points to `line 120` in `main.py` during the `startup_event`, it is clear that the application attempts to import from `dexter_brain.sandbox` at startup, which fails because the module is unavailable.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing module if it exists in a repository, or check the codebase for its location.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure dependency management is robust, using a virtual environment and a requirements file to track and install all necessary modules.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks during deployment or startup to validate all dependencies are present before proceeding.\n\n### Implementation\n#### Immediate_Action:\n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is available in the project directory or as an installable package.\n   - If it is a local module, ensure the project root is in the Python path. You can temporarily fix by adjusting `sys.path` in `main.py`:\n     ```python\n     import sys\n     sys.path.insert(0, 'M:/gliksbot/backend')  # Adjust path as necessary\n     ```\n   - If it is an external package, install it using pip:\n     ```bash\n     pip install dexter_brain\n     ```\n   - If the package is in a private repository, ensure the correct index URL is used.\n\n2. Restart the application after taking the above step.\n\n#### Permanent_Fix:\n1. Use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Create a `requirements.txt` file listing all dependencies, including `dexter_brain` if it is a package, or ensure the local module is properly referenced.\n2. If `dexter_brain` is a local module, structure the project properly and use relative imports or set `PYTHONPATH` appropriately.\n3. Implement a dependency check at startup:\n   ```python\n   try:\n       import dexter_brain\n   except ModuleNotFoundError:\n       logging.critical(\"Dependency 'dexter_brain' is missing. Please install it.\")\n       sys.exit(1)\n   ```\n\n#### Prevention:\n- Use a dependency management tool like `pipenv` or `poetry` to handle installations.\n- Include environment validation in CI/CD pipelines to ensure all dependencies are met before deployment.\n- Set up monitoring and alerts for missing dependencies during startup.\n\n#### Risk_Level: LOW\nThe proposed solutions are standard practices for dependency management and involve minimal changes to the codebase.\n\n#### Confidence: HIGH\nThis is a common issue in Python applications, and the solutions are well-established and effective."
