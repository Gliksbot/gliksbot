  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during the import in `main.py`. This is a common issue in Python applications and typically arises from:\n- The module not being installed in the current environment (virtualenv, conda, or system-wide).\n- The module not being available in the Python path (e.g., missing `__init__.py`, incorrect directory structure, or misconfigured `PYTHONPATH`).\n- A dependency management issue (e.g., `requirements.txt` not installed, or a version conflict).\n\nGiven the context (startup error, critical severity, and no prior context), it is likely that the deployment or environment setup is incomplete or corrupted. The `dexter_brain` module might be part of a custom package or a third-party dependency not properly installed.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Mitigation**: Verify the environment and install missing dependencies.\n2. **Root Cause Resolution**: Ensure consistent dependency management and environment setup.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks during deployment/startup and use robust dependency management tools.\n\n### Implementation\n#### Immediate_Action:\n1. Check if the virtual environment is activated (if used). If not, activate it.\n   ```bash\n   # Example for Windows (assuming M:\\gliksbot\\backend has a venv)\n   cd M:\\gliksbot\\backend\n   .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate  # or source venv/bin/activate on Unix\n   ```\n2. Install the missing module. If `dexter_brain` is a custom module, ensure it is in the Python path. If it is a package, install it via pip.\n   ```bash\n   pip install dexter_brain   # if it is a public package\n   ```\n   If it is a local module, ensure the directory containing `dexter_brain` is in `sys.path`. You can temporarily add it in code:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   sys.path.append('M:/gliksbot/backend/dexter_brain')  # adjust path as needed\n   ```\n3. Restart the application.\n\n#### Permanent_Fix:\n1. Use a `requirements.txt` file to manage dependencies. Ensure `dexter_brain` is listed (if public) or properly packaged (if local).\n2. For local modules, structure the project properly and use relative imports or install in editable mode:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -e .   # if setup.py exists\n   ```\n3. Validate the environment at startup with a dependency check script.\n\n#### Prevention:\n- Use dependency management tools (e.g., `pipenv`, `poetry`).\n- Add startup checks to verify critical modules are importable.\n- Implement logging and alerts for missing dependencies.\n\n#### Risk_Level: LOW\nThe solution involves standard dependency fixes with minimal disruption.\n\n#### Confidence: HIGH\nThis is a well-understood issue in Python with straightforward solutions."
