  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`, specifically when attempting to import `create_sandbox` from `dexter_brain.sandbox` during system startup. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package in the current environment. The root cause is likely one of the following:\n- The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the environment.\n- The package is installed but not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect virtual environment, misconfigured PYTHONPATH).\n- There is a version mismatch or a broken installation.\n- The module name or import path has changed, but the code hasn't been updated.\n\nGiven the critical severity and the fact that this is a startup error, the system is likely non-functional until this dependency is resolved.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing package if it exists, or check for typographical errors in the import.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure dependency management is robust, using a virtual environment and a requirements.txt or similar to track dependencies.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement pre-startup checks for critical dependencies and use CI/CD pipelines to validate environments before deployment.\n\n### Implementation\n\n**Immediate_Action**: \n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is installed by running `pip list | grep dexter_brain` (Unix) or `pip list | findstr dexter_brain` (Windows). If not found, install it via `pip install dexter_brain` (if it is a public package) or from the appropriate source (e.g., private repo, local path).\n2. If the package is installed but not found, verify the Python environment: ensure the script is running in the correct virtual environment where the package is installed.\n3. If the package does not exist (e.g., it might be a internal/custom package), check the project structure: it might be a local module. Ensure the module is in the correct directory and the PYTHONPATH includes that directory.\n\n**Permanent_Fix**:\n1. Use a virtual environment (e.g., `venv`, `conda`) to isolate dependencies.\n2. Maintain a `requirements.txt` file with all dependencies, including `dexter_brain` with the correct version.\n3. Use a script or tool (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`) to install dependencies during deployment.\n4. If `dexter_brain` is a local module, ensure it is properly packaged or included in the PYTHONPATH.\n\n**Prevention**:\n1. Add a pre-startup check in `main.py` to validate critical dependencies before attempting to import them. For example:\n```python\ntry:\n    import dexter_brain\nexcept ImportError:\n    logging.critical(\"Dependency 'dexter_brain' is missing. Please install it.\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n```\n2. Use CI/CD pipelines to run tests in an environment that mirrors production, ensuring all dependencies are correctly installed.\n3. Monitor and alert on missing dependencies during deployment or startup.\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH\n\nThis solution is low risk because it involves standard dependency management practices and does not alter core logic. The confidence is high as missing dependencies are a common issue with straightforward resolutions."
