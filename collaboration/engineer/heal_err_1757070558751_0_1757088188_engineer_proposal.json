  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`, specifically when attempting to import `create_sandbox` from `dexter_brain.sandbox` during startup. This indicates that the Python environment lacks the required `dexter_brain` package. Possible root causes include:\n- The package was not installed in the current environment.\n- There is a mismatch between the environment where the code is running and where dependencies were installed.\n- The package might be part of a local development setup that hasn't been deployed or linked correctly.\n- The import path may be incorrect if `dexter_brain` is supposed to be a local module (not a pip-installable package) and is missing from the project structure.\n\nGiven the error originates from `main.py` at startup, this is likely a deployment or environment configuration issue rather than a runtime logic error.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install missing dependencies.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure dependency management is robust and automated.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks in CI/CD and startup routines to validate environment readiness.\n\n### Implementation\n\n#### Immediate_Action\n1. Check the current Python environment:  \n   ```bash\n   python -m pip list | grep dexter-brain\n   ```\n   If not found, install it (assuming it's available on PyPI or a private index):\n   ```bash\n   python -m pip install dexter-brain\n   ```\n   If it's a local module, ensure the module directory exists at the expected path and is included in `PYTHONPATH` or the project structure.\n\n2. Alternatively, if `dexter_brain` is a local module (not a package), check the project structure:\n   ```\n   M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\\n   ├── dexter_brain/\n   │   ├── __init__.py\n   │   └── sandbox.py\n   └── main.py\n   ```\n   If missing, restore it from version control or a backup.\n\n3. Restart the application after taking corrective action.\n\n#### Permanent_Fix\n1. Use a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` to declare dependencies explicitly.\n2. Automate dependency installation during deployment:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n3. If `dexter_brain` is a local module, package it properly or use editable installs for development:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pip install -e .\n   ```\n\n#### Prevention\n1. Add environment validation at startup:\n   ```python\n   try:\n       import dexter_brain\n   except ModuleNotFoundError:\n       logging.critical(\"Missing required 'dexter_brain' module. Check dependencies.\")\n       sys.exit(1)\n   ```\n2. Include dependency checks in CI/CD pipelines to catch issues before deployment.\n3. Use virtual environments or containers to ensure environment consistency.\n\n#### Risk_Level\n**LOW** – Installing a missing package or restoring a module is low-risk if done correctly. Editable installs or environment changes are reversible.\n\n#### Confidence\n**HIGH** – This is a common issue with straightforward solutions. The error trace clearly points to a missing module.\n\n---\n\n**Collaboration Note**: This solution focuses on environment remediation. If the team suspects the module was intentionally removed or relocated, further investigation into recent changes may be needed."
