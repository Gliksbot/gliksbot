  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package during the import in `main.py` at line 120. The root cause is likely one of the following:\n- The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the current Python environment.\n- The package is installed but in a different environment than the one being used.\n- There is a typo in the module name (though the traceback suggests it's consistent).\n- The `PYTHONPATH` environment variable does not include the path to `dexter_brain`.\n- The package exists but is not properly packaged or structured (e.g., missing `__init__.py`).\n\nGiven the context (startup error, no prior context available), the most probable cause is that the dependency is missing from the environment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Install the missing package or ensure it is available in the environment.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Manage dependencies via a requirements file or a virtual environment to ensure consistency.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement dependency checks during build/deploy processes and use CI/CD pipelines to validate environments.\n4. **Risk Assessment**: The fix is low-risk as it involves adding a missing dependency, which should not disrupt existing operations if done correctly.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate_Action**: \nRun the following command to install the `dexter_brain` package (assuming it is available on PyPI or a private repository):\n```bash\npip install dexter_brain\n```\nIf it is a local package, install it from the source:\n```bash\npip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain\n```\nOr add the directory containing `dexter_brain` to `PYTHONPATH`:\n```bash\nexport PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/dexter_brain\"\n```\n\n**Permanent_Fix**:\n- Create a `requirements.txt` file listing all dependencies, including `dexter_brain`.\n- Use a virtual environment (e.g., `venv`, `conda`) to isolate dependencies.\n- For deployment, use a Docker container to ensure environment consistency.\n\nExample `requirements.txt`:\n```\ndexter_brain==1.0.0  # or the appropriate version\n```\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Add a pre-startup check in `main.py` to validate critical dependencies.\n- Use CI/CD pipelines to run tests in an environment that mirrors production.\n- Implement logging and alerts for missing dependencies during startup.\n\nExample pre-startup check:\n```python\nimport importlib\n\nrequired_modules = ['dexter_brain']\nfor module in required_modules:\n    try:\n        importlib.import_module(module)\n    except ImportError:\n        logging.error(f\"Critical dependency missing: {module}\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n```\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH"
