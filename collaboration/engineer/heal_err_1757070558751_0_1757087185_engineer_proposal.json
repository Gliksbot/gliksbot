  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` is a critical startup failure indicating that the Python module `dexter_brain` is missing from the environment where the application is running. This typically occurs due to:\n- The module not being installed in the current Python environment.\n- The module not being included in the project dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`).\n- A mismatch between the environment used for development and production (e.g., virtual environments, container images).\n- The module being part of a private or internal package that hasnâ€™t been properly distributed or installed.\n\nGiven the stack trace points to `line 120` in `main.py` during startup, this is a dependency resolution issue, not a runtime logic error.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Install the missing module or check the environment setup.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure dependency management is robust and consistent across environments.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement dependency checks during CI/CD and startup validation.\n4. **Risk Assessment**: The fix is low-risk as it involves dependency management, not core logic changes.\n\n### Implementation\n\n#### Immediate_Action\n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is available in the Python environment:\n   ```bash\n   python -c \"import dexter_brain\"\n   ```\n   If it fails, install it. If it's a private package, ensure it's accessible (e.g., via pip from a private repository, or local install).\n2. If the module is local (e.g., in the project directory), ensure the Python path includes the project root:\n   ```bash\n   export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/project/root:$PYTHONPATH\n   ```\n   (Adjust for Windows: `set PYTHONPATH=M:\\gliksbot\\backend;%PYTHONPATH%`).\n3. Restart the application.\n\n#### Permanent_Fix\n1. Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` if it's a package:\n   ```txt\n   # requirements.txt\n   dexter_brain==1.0.0  # or appropriate version\n   ```\n   If it's a local module, ensure it's packaged or deployed with the code.\n2. Use a virtual environment or container to isolate dependencies.\n3. Implement a dependency check at startup:\n   ```python\n   # In main.py, before importing dexter_brain\n   try:\n       import dexter_brain\n   except ModuleNotFoundError:\n       logging.critical(\"Dependency missing: dexter_brain. Install it and restart.\")\n       sys.exit(1)\n   ```\n\n#### Prevention\n1. Add a pre-startup check in CI/CD to validate all dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   python -c \"import dexter_brain\"  # Repeat for critical modules\n   ```\n2. Use tools like `pip check` to verify dependency consistency.\n3. Monitor for `ModuleNotFoundError` in logs and alert on critical missing dependencies.\n\n#### Risk_Level\n**LOW** - The solution involves dependency management and does not alter application logic.\n\n#### Confidence\n**HIGH** - This is a common Python dependency issue with straightforward solutions.\n\n### Collaboration Note\nThis error is environment-specific and likely resolvable by ensuring the module is installed. If `dexter_brain` is a custom module, verify its location and Python path. Team should check the deployment process for missing dependency steps."
