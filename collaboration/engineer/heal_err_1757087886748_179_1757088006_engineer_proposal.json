  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error pattern `HEALING_TIMEOUT:error_healer` indicates that the system's error healing mechanism is timing out repeatedly. Given the context:\n- This is a recurring pattern (3 times in 10 minutes) originating from `error_tracker`.\n- The system has high recent errors (120) and critical errors (2), suggesting elevated load or instability.\n- The root cause likely involves:\n  - **Resource exhaustion**: The `error_healer` process may be blocked by high CPU/memory usage or I/O waits due to the surge in errors.\n  - **Inefficient healing logic**: The healing routine might be attempting to resolve too many errors concurrently or getting stuck in a loop.\n  - **Dependencies**: External services or databases required for healing might be slow or unresponsive, causing timeouts.\n  - **Configuration issues**: Timeout thresholds might be set too low for the current system load.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate mitigation**: Reduce load on the error healer by prioritizing critical errors and temporarily suspending non-urgent healing tasks.\n2. **Permanent fix**: Refactor the healing logic to be more efficient, implement retries with backoff, and adjust timeouts based on system metrics.\n3. **Prevention**: Enhance monitoring for the error healer's performance and set up alerts for timeouts or resource usage spikes.\n\n### Implementation\n#### Immediate_Action:\n- **Step 1**: Temporarily disable the error healer for non-critical errors (e.g., via a feature flag or config change) to reduce load.\n- **Step 2**: Increase the timeout threshold for `error_healer` in the configuration (e.g., from 30s to 60s) to accommodate current load.\n- **Step 3**: Restart the error healer service to clear any stuck processes (ensure graceful restart to avoid losing context).\n- **Step 4**: Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, I/O) and check for bottlenecks; if needed, scale up resources temporarily.\n\n#### Permanent_Fix:\n- **Refactor healing logic**:\n  - Implement asynchronous processing for healing tasks using a queue (e.g., Redis or RabbitMQ) to avoid blocking.\n  - Add circuit breakers for external dependencies to prevent cascading timeouts.\n  - Use incremental healing: Prioritize errors by severity and process in batches.\n- **Adjust timeouts dynamically** based on system load (e.g., using adaptive algorithms).\n- **Add detailed logging** to capture healing duration and failures for better debugging.\n\n#### Prevention:\n- **Monitoring**: Set up dashboards to track error healer latency, success rate, and resource usage.\n- **Alerts**: Configure alerts for:\n  - Healing timeouts exceeding a threshold (e.g., >50ms per task).\n  - Resource usage (CPU >80%, memory >90%).\n  - Spike in error rates (>100 errors/min).\n- **Code changes**: Add unit tests for healing logic and load-test the error healer under high-error scenarios.\n\n#### Risk_Level: MEDIUM\n- Immediate actions are low-risk (config changes and restarts), but refactoring requires careful testing to avoid introducing new issues.\n\n#### Confidence: HIGH\n- The approach addresses common causes of timeouts (resource exhaustion and inefficient processing) and is based on proven patterns (queues, circuit breakers).\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (if needed for new healing logic):\nIf implementing a queue-based healing system, hereâ€™s a Python example using Redis and RQ:\n```python\nfrom redis import Redis\nfrom rq import Queue\nfrom error_healer import heal_error\n\n# Initialize queue\nredis_conn = Redis(host='localhost', port=6379)\nhealing_queue = Queue('healing', connection=redis_conn)\n\n# Enqueue healing tasks asynchronously\ndef enqueue_healing(error_id):\n    healing_queue.enqueue(heal_error, error_id, timeout=60)  # 60s timeout\n\n# Monitor queue health and scale workers as needed\n```\nThis decouples healing from the main error tracker, reducing timeouts and improving resilience."
