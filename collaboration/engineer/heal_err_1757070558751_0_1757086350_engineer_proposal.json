  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`, specifically when attempting to import `from dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox` in `main.py` at line 120 during startup. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package in the current environment. Possible root causes include:\n- The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the environment.\n- The package is installed but not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect virtual environment, missing `__init__.py`, or misconfigured PYTHONPATH).\n- The package exists but has been corrupted or improperly installed.\n- There might be a version mismatch or dependency issue.\n\nGiven the context of a startup error and the absence of additional context, the most likely cause is that the required package is missing from the deployment environment or the virtual environment is not activated correctly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing package if it exists in a repository.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure dependency management is robust, using a requirements.txt or a similar mechanism to track and install all necessary packages.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks in the startup sequence to validate all dependencies before attempting to import them, and use continuous integration (CI) to test the environment setup.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate_Action**: \n- Check if the virtual environment is activated. If not, activate it.\n- Run `pip list` to see if `dexter_brain` is installed. If not, install it using `pip install dexter_brain` (if it is available on PyPI) or from a local source/private repository.\n- If the package is installed but still not found, check the Python path and ensure the environment variables are set correctly.\n\n**Permanent_Fix**:\n- Maintain a `requirements.txt` file with all dependencies, including `dexter_brain`.\n- Use a virtual environment and ensure it is version-controlled or documented.\n- In the startup script, add a pre-flight check to validate that all required packages are installed before proceeding.\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Add a dependency check at the beginning of `main.py`:\n  ```python\n  import pkg_resources\n  required = {'dexter_brain'}  # add other dependencies as needed\n  installed = {pkg.key for pkg in pkg_resources.working_set}\n  missing = required - installed\n  if missing:\n      raise RuntimeError(f\"Missing dependencies: {missing}\")\n  ```\n- Integrate this check into CI/CD pipelines to catch missing dependencies early.\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH\n\nThis approach is low-risk as it involves standard dependency management practices and does not disrupt existing operations if implemented correctly. The immediate action is straightforward and should resolve the issue if the package is available for installation."
