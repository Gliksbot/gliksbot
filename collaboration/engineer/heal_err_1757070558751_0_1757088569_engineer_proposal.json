  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package during the import in `main.py` at line 120. The root cause is likely one of the following:\n- The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the current Python environment.\n- The package is installed but not in the Python path (e.g., due to virtual environment issues, incorrect PYTHONPATH, or a misconfigured workspace).\n- The package exists but is corrupted or incomplete.\n- There might be a typo or case sensitivity issue in the module name (though `dexter_brain` appears consistent).\n\nGiven the context of a startup error and the absence of prior context, this is likely an environment setup or dependency issue.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the installation and availability of the `dexter_brain` module in the current environment.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure robust dependency management and environment consistency, possibly using virtual environments and dependency locks.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks during startup or in CI/CD pipelines to validate all dependencies before deployment.\n\n### Implementation\n\n#### Immediate_Action:\nRun the following commands in the terminal to diagnose and mitigate:\n```bash\n# Check if dexter_brain is installed\npip list | grep dexter_brain\n\n# If not found, install it (assuming it's available via pip or a repository)\npip install dexter_brain\n\n# Alternatively, if it's a local package, ensure it's in the Python path\n# For example, if it's in a subdirectory, add it to PYTHONPATH or install in development mode\nexport PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/dexter_brain_parent_dir\"\n# Or\npip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain\n\n# Then restart the application\npython M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\main.py\n```\n\n#### Permanent_Fix:\n- Use a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` to explicitly declare dependencies.\n- Utilize a virtual environment to isolate dependencies. For example:\n  ```bash\n  python -m venv venv\n  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  ```\n- Ensure the startup script activates the correct environment.\n\n#### Prevention:\n- Add a pre-startup check in `main.py` to validate critical imports:\n  ```python\n  def check_dependencies():\n      required_modules = ['dexter_brain']\n      for module in required_modules:\n          try:\n              __import__(module)\n          except ImportError:\n              raise RuntimeError(f\"Required module {module} is not installed.\")\n  \n  # Call this function before any other imports in startup_event\n  ```\n- Integrate dependency checks in CI/CD pipelines to fail fast if dependencies are missing.\n\n#### Risk_Level: LOW\nThe solution involves standard dependency management practices with minimal risk.\n\n#### Confidence: HIGH\nThis is a common issue with well-established solutions in Python environments."
