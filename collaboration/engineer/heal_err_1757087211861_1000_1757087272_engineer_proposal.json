  "content": "### Analysis\nThe `HEALING_TIMEOUT` error indicates that the error healing system itself is failing to resolve an underlying error within its expected timeframe. Given that the source is `error_healer`, this suggests a recursive or cascading failure where the healing mechanism is either:\n1. Overwhelmed by the volume of errors (1000 recent errors)\n2. Stuck in an infinite loop attempting to heal the original error\n3. Lacking sufficient resources (CPU/memory/timeouts) to complete healing operations\n\nThe absence of stack trace suggests either the healing system is failing silently or the timeout is occurring at the orchestration level rather than within specific healing logic.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Triage**: Implement circuit breaker pattern for the healing system to prevent cascading failures\n2. **Resource Assessment**: Evaluate system resources and adjust timeouts/retries accordingly\n3. **Root Cause Investigation**: Add detailed logging to the healing process to identify what's causing the timeout\n4. **Graceful Degradation**: Implement fallback mechanisms when healing fails\n\n### Implementation\n\n**Immediate Action (Circuit Breaker Implementation):**\n```python\n# Add to error_healer service\nclass HealingCircuitBreaker:\n    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=3, reset_timeout=60):\n        self.failure_count = 0\n        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold\n        self.reset_timeout = reset_timeout\n        self.last_failure_time = None\n        self.state = \"CLOSED\"\n    \n    def execute_healing(self, error_id):\n        if self.state == \"OPEN\":\n            if time.time() - self.last_failure_time > self.reset_timeout:\n                self.state = \"HALF_OPEN\"\n            else:\n                raise CircuitBreakerOpenException()\n        \n        try:\n            result = self._attempt_healing(error_id)\n            if self.state == \"HALF_OPEN\":\n                self.state = \"CLOSED\"\n                self.failure_count = 0\n            return result\n        except Exception as e:\n            self._record_failure()\n            raise\n    \n    def _record_failure(self):\n        self.failure_count += 1\n        self.last_failure_time = time.time()\n        if self.failure_count >= self.failure_threshold:\n            self.state = \"OPEN\"\n```\n\n**Permanent Fix (Enhanced Healing with Timeout Management):**\n```python\n# SKILL_SPEC: Enhanced timeout management with progressive backoff\ndef heal_error_with_timeout_management(error_id, max_attempts=3):\n    attempts = 0\n    base_timeout = 30  # seconds\n    max_timeout = 300\n    \n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        current_timeout = min(base_timeout * (2 ** attempts), max_timeout)\n        \n        try:\n            with timeout(current_timeout):\n                return perform_healing_operation(error_id)\n        except TimeoutError:\n            attempts += 1\n            log_healing_attempt(error_id, attempts, current_timeout)\n            if attempts >= max_attempts:\n                escalate_to_human(error_id)\n                raise HealingTimeoutException(f\"Failed after {attempts} attempts\")\n            \n            # Wait with exponential backoff before retry\n            time.sleep(2 ** attempts)\n```\n\n**Prevention (Monitoring and Alerting):**\n- Implement Prometheus metrics for healing success/failure rates\n- Set up alert when healing failure rate exceeds 5%\n- Add detailed structured logging for all healing operations\n- Create dashboard showing healing latency distribution\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- **Risk Level**: LOW - Circuit breaker pattern is well-established and safe\n- **Confidence**: HIGH - This approach follows proven patterns for handling timeouts and cascading failures\n\nThe circuit breaker prevents system overload while the enhanced timeout management provides robust error handling. Monitoring ensures we can detect issues before they become critical."
