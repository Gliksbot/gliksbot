  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during the import process in `main.py`. This is a common issue in Python applications and typically stems from one of the following root causes:\n1. The module is not installed in the current Python environment.\n2. The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect directory structure or missing `__init__.py` files).\n3. The module name is misspelled or has been renamed.\n4. The environment (virtual environment, system PATH) is misconfigured.\n\nGiven the context—startup failure with no prior context—it is highly probable that the `dexter_brain` package is either missing from the environment or improperly packaged/distributed. The stack trace points to an absolute import (`from dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox`), suggesting `dexter_brain` is expected to be a top-level package.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the presence of `dexter_brain` in the environment and attempt a reinstall if missing.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure the package is properly defined in `pyproject.toml`/`setup.py` and installed via a reliable method (e.g., pip from a version-controlled source).\n3. **Prevention**: Implement dependency checks during startup or in CI/CD pipelines to catch missing modules early.\n4. **Risk Assessment**: The proposed solutions are low-risk as they involve environment adjustments without code changes.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate_Action**:  \nRun the following commands in the backend directory (`M:\\gliksbot\\backend`):\n```bash\n# Check if dexter_brain is installed\npip list | grep dexter_brain\n\n# If not found, install it (assuming it's a local package)\npip install -e .  # if dexter_brain is part of the project\n# OR if it's in a separate directory/repo\npip install /path/to/dexter_brain\n\n# Alternatively, check PYTHONPATH\necho $PYTHONPATH  # Ensure it includes the directory containing dexter_brain\n```\n\n**Permanent_Fix**:  \n1. Define `dexter_brain` as a dependency in `pyproject.toml`:\n```toml\n[project]\ndependencies = [\n    \"dexter_brain @ git+https://github.com/yourorg/dexter_brain.git\",  # or use a versioned package\n]\n```\n2. Use a virtual environment and ensure dependencies are installed during deployment:\n```bash\npython -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate  # or venv\\Scripts\\activate on Windows\npip install -r requirements.txt  # include dexter_brain\n```\n\n**Prevention**:  \nAdd a pre-startup check in `main.py`:\n```python\nimport importlib\nrequired_modules = ['dexter_brain']\nfor module in required_modules:\n    try:\n        importlib.import_module(module)\n    except ImportError:\n        raise RuntimeError(f\"Critical dependency missing: {module}\")\n```\nIntegrate this check in CI/CD to fail fast if dependencies are missing.\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH"
