  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `HEALING_TIMEOUT` indicates that the `error_healer` subsystem itself is failing to resolve another error (`err_1757084662442_65`) within an expected timeframe. Given the context of 23 related `HEALING_TIMEOUT` errors and 12 recent errors, this suggests a systemic issue rather than an isolated incident. The root cause likely involves:\n- **Resource exhaustion**: The healing process may be consuming excessive CPU, memory, or I/O, causing timeouts.\n- **Recursive or infinite healing loops**: The healer might be attempting to heal errors that trigger further errors.\n- **Concurrency issues**: High system load with multiple errors occurring simultaneously could overwhelm the healer's capacity.\n- **Inefficient healing logic**: The current implementation may not handle certain error types efficiently, leading to prolonged resolution times.\n\nSince the stack trace is unavailable, the diagnosis leans on pattern recognition from the error history and system status.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Mitigation**: Temporarily suspend non-critical healing processes to reduce load, allowing the system to stabilize.\n2. **Investigation**: Enable detailed logging for the `error_healer` module to capture stack traces and resource usage during healing attempts.\n3. **Permanent Fix**: Refactor the healing logic to include timeouts, circuit breakers, and better error classification to prevent recursive healing and resource exhaustion.\n4. **Prevention**: Implement monitoring and alerting for healing timeouts and resource usage, with automated fallbacks.\n\n### Implementation\n\n**Immediate_Action**:\n- **Step 1**: Identify and pause low-priority healing tasks. For example, if using a task queue, lower the priority or suspend tasks for non-critical errors.\n- **Step 2**: Increase the timeout threshold temporarily for the healing process to allow completion of ongoing tasks (if safe).\n- **Step 3**: Restart the `error_healer` service to clear any stuck states, ensuring it reloads with default resources.\n\nCode snippet to adjust timeouts (if configurable):\n```yaml\n# config.yaml for error_healer\nhealing_timeout: 300s  # Increase from default 60s to 300s temporarily\nmax_concurrent_heals: 5  # Reduce concurrency to limit resource usage\n```\n\n**Permanent_Fix**:\n- Refactor the healing logic to include:\n  - **Timeout handling**: Ensure each healing attempt has a hard timeout, after which it is aborted and logged.\n  - **Circuit breaker**: If an error type repeatedly times out, mark it as \"unhealable\" and skip future attempts temporarily.\n  - **Resource monitoring**: Check system resources (CPU, memory) before starting a heal, and delay if thresholds are exceeded.\n  - **Error classification**: Prioritize errors based on severity and type, healing critical ones first.\n\nExample circuit breaker implementation:\n```python\nclass HealingCircuitBreaker:\n    def __init__(self, max_attempts=3, reset_timeout=300):\n        self.failures = {}\n        self.max_attempts = max_attempts\n        self.reset_timeout = reset_timeout  # seconds\n\n    def should_attempt_heal(self, error_id):\n        if error_id in self.failures:\n            failures, last_attempt = self.failures[error_id]\n            if failures >= self.max_attempts:\n                if time.time() - last_attempt < self.reset_timeout:\n                    return False  # Circuit open\n                else:\n                    del self.failures[error_id]  # Reset after timeout\n        return True\n\n    def record_failure(self, error_id):\n        if error_id not in self.failures:\n            self.failures[error_id] = [1, time.time()]\n        else:\n            self.failures[error_id][0] += 1\n            self.failures[error_id][1] = time.time()\n```\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Add monitoring for:\n  - Healing success rate and timeouts (e.g., Prometheus metrics).\n  - System resources during healing (CPU, memory, I/O).\n- Set up alerts for:\n  - Healing timeouts exceeding a threshold (e.g., >5 in 10 minutes).\n  - Resource usage above 80% during healing processes.\n- Implement automated fallbacks: If timeouts persist, automatically disable healing for non-critical errors and notify engineers.\n\n**Risk_Level**: MEDIUM (temporary changes might delay error resolution but reduce system load).\n**Confidence**: HIGH (based on common patterns in self-healing systems and resource management)."
