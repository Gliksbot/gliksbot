  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`, specifically when attempting to import `create_sandbox` from `dexter_brain.sandbox` during startup. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package in the current environment. Possible root causes include:\n- The package `dexter_brain` is not installed in the environment.\n- The package is installed but not on the Python path (e.g., incorrect virtual environment, misconfigured PYTHONPATH).\n- The package name or module structure has changed (e.g., renamed or moved).\n- There is a version mismatch or dependency issue (e.g., `dexter_brain` requires a specific version not met).\n\nGiven the context (startup error, no prior context available), the most likely cause is missing installation or environment misconfiguration.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing package if it exists, or check for typographical errors in the import statement.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure proper dependency management (e.g., using `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`) and automate environment setup.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks during deployment/startup to validate all dependencies are present, and use CI/CD pipelines to catch such issues early.\n4. **Risk Assessment**: The immediate action is low-risk if we are certain about the package name and source. Modifying environment setup has medium risk if not tested thoroughly.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate_Action**: \n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is installed: run `pip list | grep dexter_brain` (Unix) or `pip list | findstr dexter_brain` (Windows) in the environment.\n2. If not installed, install it: `pip install dexter_brain` (if available on PyPI) or from a specific source (e.g., `pip install git+<repository_url>`).\n3. If installed but not found, check Python path: ensure the environment is activated and paths are correct.\n4. If the package does not exist, investigate the correct package name or source (e.g., check project documentation or source code).\n\n**Permanent_Fix**:\n1. Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` with the correct version.\n2. Use a virtual environment and ensure it is activated before running the application.\n3. Automate dependency installation during deployment (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`).\n\n**Prevention**:\n1. Add a pre-startup check in `main.py` to validate critical dependencies (e.g., try importing key modules and handle errors gracefully with helpful messages).\n2. Implement CI/CD checks that run `pip check` or attempt a dry-run import in a test environment before deployment.\n3. Use dependency management tools like `pipenv` or `poetry` to lock versions and manage environments consistently.\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW (immediate action), MEDIUM (permanent fix if not tested)\n**Confidence**: HIGH (standard missing package issue)\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (if needed)\nNo new skill required; this is a common Python environment issue resolvable with standard tools."
