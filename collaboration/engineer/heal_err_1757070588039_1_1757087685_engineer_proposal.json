  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during the startup of the application. This is a critical startup error, likely caused by one of the following:\n- The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the current Python environment.\n- The module is installed but in a different environment or path not accessible to the application.\n- There may be a version mismatch or a broken installation.\n- The import statement in `main.py` (line 120) is incorrect or the module structure has changed.\n\nGiven the context that this is a startup error with no additional context, the most probable root cause is a missing dependency in the deployment or development environment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing module if it exists, or check the integrity of the existing installation.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure dependency management is robust, using a requirements.txt or a virtual environment to maintain consistency across environments.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks during deployment or startup to validate all dependencies are present before proceeding.\n\n### Implementation\n\n#### Immediate_Action:\n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is installed by running:\n   ```bash\n   pip list | grep dexter_brain\n   ```\n   or in Python:\n   ```python\n   import pkg_resources\n   try:\n       pkg_resources.get_distribution(\"dexter_brain\")\n       print(\"dexter_brain is installed.\")\n   except pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound:\n       print(\"dexter_brain is not installed.\")\n   ```\n\n2. If not installed, install it using pip (if it's a public package):\n   ```bash\n   pip install dexter_brain\n   ```\n   If it's a private package, ensure the correct repository or path is accessible and install from there.\n\n3. If installed, check the Python path and environment to ensure the application is running in the correct context.\n\n#### Permanent_Fix:\n1. Use a `requirements.txt` file to list all dependencies, including `dexter_brain`.\n2. Use a virtual environment (e.g., venv, conda) to isolate dependencies.\n3. In `main.py`, before attempting to import, add a check for required modules:\n   ```python\n   try:\n       from dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox\n   except ModuleNotFoundError as e:\n       logging.error(f\"Missing dependency: {e}. Please install dexter_brain.\")\n       sys.exit(1)\n   ```\n4. Ensure CI/CD pipelines install dependencies from `requirements.txt` during deployment.\n\n#### Prevention:\n1. Add a pre-startup check script that validates all dependencies.\n2. Use tools like `pip check` to verify dependency consistency.\n3. Set up monitoring and alerts for missing dependencies in logs.\n\n#### Risk_Level: LOW\nThe solution involves standard dependency management practices with minimal risk.\n\n#### Confidence: HIGH\nThis is a common issue with well-established solutions in Python environments.\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (if needed)\nNot required for this solution, as it relies on standard Python dependency management."
