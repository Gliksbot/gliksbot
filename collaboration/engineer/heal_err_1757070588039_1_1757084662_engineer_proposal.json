  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during the import process in `main.py`. This is a common issue in Python applications and typically arises due to one of the following root causes:\n\n1. **Missing Dependency**: The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the current Python environment.\n2. **Path Issue**: The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect working directory or misconfigured module structure).\n3. **Version Mismatch**: An older or incompatible version of the package is installed.\n4. **Virtual Environment Issue**: The application is running in a virtual environment where the package is missing.\n\nGiven the stack trace points to `startup_event` in `main.py`, this is likely a deployment or environment setup issue rather than a code logic error.\n\n### Approach\nTo resolve this, we should:\n1. **Verify Installation**: Check if `dexter_brain` is installed and accessible.\n2. **Environment Check**: Ensure the correct Python environment is activated.\n3. **Dependency Management**: Use a requirements.txt or similar to manage dependencies explicitly.\n4. **Path Configuration**: Adjust sys.path if the module is in a non-standard location.\n\n### Implementation\nHere are concrete steps:\n\n#### Immediate_Action:\n1. **Check Installed Packages**:  \n   Run `pip list | grep dexter_brain` (or `pip freeze | findstr dexter_brain` on Windows) to verify if the package is installed.\n2. **Install Missing Package**:  \n   If not found, install it via pip:  \n   `pip install dexter_brain`  \n   If it's a local module, install in editable mode:  \n   `pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain`  \n3. **Restart Application**:  \n   After installation, restart the application to see if the error resolves.\n\n#### Permanent_Fix:\n1. **Use requirements.txt**:  \n   Ensure `dexter_brain` is listed in `requirements.txt` (or similar) with the correct version. Example:  \n   ```\n   dexter_brain==1.0.0\n   ```\n2. **Automate Dependency Installation**:  \n   In your startup script or Dockerfile, include:  \n   `pip install -r requirements.txt`  \n3. **Validate Environment**:  \n   Use virtual environments (venv) or containers (Docker) to isolate dependencies and ensure consistency.\n\n#### Prevention:\n1. **Pre-deployment Checks**:  \n   Add a pre-start validation script that checks for all required modules:  \n   ```python\n   import importlib\n   required_modules = ['dexter_brain']\n   for module in required_modules:\n       try:\n           importlib.import_module(module)\n       except ImportError:\n           raise SystemExit(f\"Error: Missing required module {module}\")\n   ```\n2. **CI/CD Integration**:  \n   Include dependency checks in your CI pipeline to catch missing modules before deployment.\n3. **Logging and Monitoring**:  \n   Enhance logging to capture environment details (e.g., Python path, installed packages) on startup for easier debugging.\n\n#### Risk_Level:  \n**LOW** - Installing a missing package or adjusting paths is low-risk and non-disruptive.\n\n#### Confidence:  \n**HIGH** - This is a standard Python dependency issue with well-established solutions.\n\n### Collaboration Note:\nIf `dexter_brain` is a custom/internal module, ensure it is properly packaged and distributed. If the team confirms it is a local module, we might need to adjust the PYTHONPATH or module structure."
