  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`, specifically during the import of `dexter_brain.sandbox` in `main.py` at startup. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package in the current environment. Possible root causes include:\n- The package is not installed in the environment.\n- The package is installed but not on the Python path (e.g., incorrect virtual environment, missing `__init__.py`, or misconfigured PYTHONPATH).\n- The package name has changed or the module was moved/renamed.\n- A dependency or submodule is missing even if the main package exists.\n\nGiven the context (startup error, no prior context), the most likely cause is that the `dexter_brain` package is missing from the deployment environment or the runtime environment is misconfigured.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing package if it exists, or check for typos/misconfigurations.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure the package is properly defined, packaged, and included in the environment setup (e.g., via requirements.txt or setup.py).\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks during build/deployment to validate all dependencies are present, and use virtual environments to isolate dependencies.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate Action Steps**:\n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is installed:  \n   Run `pip list | grep dexter_brain` (Unix) or `pip list | findstr dexter_brain` (Windows). If not found, install it.\n2. If the package is supposed to be local, ensure the directory structure is correct and `__init__.py` files are present.\n3. Verify the Python path: Check `sys.path` in the runtime environment to ensure the package directory is included.\n\n**Permanent Fix**:\n- Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` if it is a external package.\n- If it is an internal package, ensure it is properly packaged and deployed with the application (e.g., include in source control or build artifacts).\n- Use a virtual environment and automate dependency installation during deployment.\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Add a pre-startup check in `main.py` to validate critical imports.\n- Use CI/CD pipelines to run dependency checks and tests before deployment.\n- Monitor for `ModuleNotFoundError` in logs and alert on missing dependencies.\n\n**Risk Level**: LOW (installing a missing package or fixing a path issue is low risk if the package is stable).  \n**Confidence**: HIGH (common issue with straightforward resolution).\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (if needed for automation)\nIf automating the fix, create a script to check and install missing dependencies:\n```python\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\n\ndef check_and_install(package_name):\n    try:\n        __import__(package_name)\n    except ImportError:\n        subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, \"-m\", \"pip\", \"install\", package_name])\n\ncheck_and_install('dexter_brain')\n```\nAdd this to `main.py` before the failing import (note: this may not work for internal packages; adjust accordingly)."
