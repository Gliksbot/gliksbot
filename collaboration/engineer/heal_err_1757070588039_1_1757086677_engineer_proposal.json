  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` is a critical startup failure indicating that the Python module `dexter_brain` is missing from the environment where the application is running. This typically occurs due to:\n- The module not being installed in the current Python environment.\n- The module not being included in the project dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`).\n- A mismatch between the environment where the code was developed and the runtime environment (e.g., virtual environment not activated, incorrect Python path).\n- The module might be part of a private or internal package not available in public repositories.\n\nGiven the stack trace points to `line 120` in `main.py` attempting to import from `dexter_brain.sandbox`, it is likely that `dexter_brain` is a core dependency for the application's functionality.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Mitigation**: Verify the environment and install the missing module if it exists in a repository or locally.\n2. **Root Cause Resolution**: Ensure the dependency is properly declared and managed in the project's dependency configuration.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks during development and deployment to catch missing dependencies early.\n\n### Implementation\n\n#### Immediate_Action:\n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is available in a package repository (e.g., PyPI) or a private repository:\n   ```bash\n   pip search dexter_brain\n   ```\n   If found, install it:\n   ```bash\n   pip install dexter_brain\n   ```\n2. If it is a local module, ensure it is in the Python path. For example, if it resides in a directory adjacent to `main.py`, you might need to adjust the path:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   sys.path.append('/path/to/dexter_brain_parent_directory')\n   ```\n   (Note: This is a temporary fix; avoid hardcoding paths in production.)\n\n3. Restart the application to see if the error resolves.\n\n#### Permanent_Fix:\n1. Add `dexter_brain` to your `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`:\n   ```txt\n   # requirements.txt\n   dexter_brain==1.0.0  # specify the correct version\n   ```\n2. If it is a local module, consider packaging it properly and installing it in editable mode:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain\n   ```\n3. Use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and ensure consistency between development and production.\n\n#### Prevention:\n1. Use a dependency management tool like `pip-tools` or `poetry` to pin versions and manage environments.\n2. Implement CI/CD checks that verify all dependencies are installed before deployment, e.g.,:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   python -c \"import dexter_brain; print('Dependency check passed')\"\n   ```\n3. Add module import checks in the application startup sequence to provide meaningful error messages if critical modules are missing.\n\n#### Risk_Level: LOW\n- Installing a missing dependency is low risk if the module is stable and version-compatible.\n- Path adjustments are riskier if not handled properly (e.g., hardcoded paths) but can be mitigated with environment variables or configuration.\n\n#### Confidence: HIGH\n- The error is straightforward and common in Python applications. The solution is well-tested and standard practice.\n\n### Collaboration Note:\nIf `dexter_brain` is a proprietary or internal module, ensure it is accessible from the runtime environment. If it does not exist, this may indicate a larger issue with the codebase or deployment process."
