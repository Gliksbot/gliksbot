  "content": "### Analysis\nThe `HEALING_TIMEOUT` error indicates that the error_healer subsystem itself is failing to resolve another error (`err_1757087129151_604`) within an expected timeframe. This suggests a recursive or cascading failure where the healing mechanism is either stuck in an infinite loop, overwhelmed by system load, or encountering a pathological case it cannot handle. Given that the source is `error_healer`, the root cause likely involves resource exhaustion (e.g., CPU, memory, or thread starvation) or a logical deadlock in the healing logic. The absence of a stack trace implies the timeout may have occurred at a system level rather than within application code.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Mitigation**: Temporarily bypass the faulty healing attempt to prevent system degradation, while preserving error context for later analysis.\n2. **Diagnostic Enhancement**: Improve logging and monitoring around the error_healer to capture state during timeouts.\n3. **Resilience Engineering**: Implement circuit breakers and timeouts within the error_healer to prevent cascading failures.\n4. **Root Cause Investigation**: Analyze the original error (`err_1757087129151_604`) to determine why it triggered a healing timeout.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate Action**:\n```python\n# In error_healer service, add a guard to skip healing if too many attempts\nMAX_HEALING_ATTEMPTS = 3\nif current_attempt >= MAX_HEALING_ATTEMPTS:\n    log_error(f\"Healing abandoned for {error_id} after {MAX_HEALING_ATTEMPTS} attempts\")\n    escalate_to_human(error_id, context)  # Route to manual review\n    return\n```\n\n**Permanent Fix**:\n```python\n# Add timeout wrapper around healing logic\nimport signal\n\ndef with_timeout(seconds, func, *args, **kwargs):\n    def timeout_handler(signum, frame):\n        raise TimeoutError(f\"Function timed out after {seconds} seconds\")\n    \n    signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, timeout_handler)\n    signal.alarm(seconds)\n    try:\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n    finally:\n        signal.alarm(0)\n    return result\n\n# Usage in healing process\ntry:\n    healing_result = with_timeout(30, heal_error, error_id, context)\nexcept TimeoutError:\n    log_error(f\"Healing timeout for {error_id}\")\n    queue_for_retry(error_id, context, delay=300)  # Backoff retry\n```\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Add monitoring for healing duration and success rate\n- Implement circuit breaker pattern to disable healing after consecutive failures\n- Add resource usage checks before attempting healing\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH\n\nThe solution prioritizes stability by containing the failure while preserving diagnostic information. The timeout wrapper prevents infinite blocking, and the circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures."
