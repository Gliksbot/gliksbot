  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during the import process in `main.py`. This is a common issue in Python applications and typically arises due to one of the following reasons:\n- The module is not installed in the current environment.\n- The module exists but is not in the Python path.\n- There is a typo in the module name or incorrect directory structure.\n- The module was not included in the project dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt`).\n\nGiven the context of a startup error in a backend system (`M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\main.py`), it is likely that the `dexter_brain` package is either missing from the environment or improperly configured. The absence of context suggests this might be a deployment or environment setup issue rather than a code logic error.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Verify Environment and Dependencies**: Check if the `dexter_brain` module is installed and accessible. If not, install it or correct the path.\n2. **Temporary Workaround**: If the module is critical but unavailable, consider mocking or stubbing the functionality temporarily to allow other systems to initialize, but this is risky if the module is essential.\n3. **Long-term Solution**: Ensure the module is properly documented in dependencies and that the deployment process includes dependency installation.\n4. **Prevention**: Implement checks during startup to validate critical dependencies and provide meaningful error messages.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate Action**:\n1. Check the current Python environment:\n   ```bash\n   pip list | grep dexter_brain\n   ```\n   If not found, install it (if available via pip) or clone the repository:\n   ```bash\n   pip install dexter_brain  # If it is a public package\n   # OR\n   git clone <repository_url> && pip install -e ./dexter_brain  # If it is a local package\n   ```\n2. If the module is local, ensure the directory structure is correct and that `dexter_brain` is in the Python path. You can temporarily add the path in `main.py`:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   sys.path.append('/path/to/dexter_brain_parent_directory')\n   from dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox\n   ```\n3. If the module is not available at all, consider commenting out the import and related code temporarily (if non-critical) and log a warning. However, this should only be a last resort.\n\n**Permanent Fix**:\n1. Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` to ensure it is installed during deployment.\n2. Use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and ensure consistency across environments.\n3. Implement a health check or startup validation script that verifies all required modules are installed before starting the application.\n\n**Prevention**:\n1. Add a pre-startup check in `main.py` to validate critical imports:\n   ```python\n   def check_dependencies():\n       required_modules = ['dexter_brain']\n       for module in required_modules:\n           try:\n               __import__(module)\n           except ImportError:\n               raise RuntimeError(f\"Required module {module} is not installed.\")\n   \n   # Call this function before any other imports in startup_event\n   ```\n2. Set up continuous integration (CI) to run dependency checks and tests before deployment.\n3. Use logging and monitoring to alert on missing dependencies during startup.\n\n**Risk Level**: LOW (if the module is available and correctly installed) to MEDIUM (if temporary workarounds are used).\n**Confidence**: HIGH (this is a standard dependency resolution issue with well-known solutions).\n\n### SKILL_SPEC\nNo new skill is required; this involves standard Python dependency management and environment troubleshooting."
