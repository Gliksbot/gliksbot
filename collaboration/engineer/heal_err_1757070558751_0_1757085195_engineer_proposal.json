  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`, specifically when attempting to import `create_sandbox` from `dexter_brain.sandbox` during system startup. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package in the current environment. Potential root causes include:\n- The package is not installed in the environment.\n- The package is installed but not in the Python path (e.g., wrong virtual environment, incorrect PYTHONPATH).\n- The package name or module structure has changed (e.g., renamed or moved).\n- There is a version mismatch or dependency issue.\n\nGiven the context (startup error, no prior context), the most likely cause is that the `dexter_brain` package is missing from the deployment environment or the virtual environment is not activated correctly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing package if it exists, or check for environment misconfiguration.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure proper dependency management and environment setup through version-controlled requirements and automated deployment checks.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement pre-startup validation scripts and monitoring for dependency health.\n\n### Implementation\n#### Immediate_Action\n1. Check if the virtual environment is activated:  \n   - On Windows: `where python` should point to the project's venv (e.g., `M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\venv\\Scripts\\python.exe`).  \n   - If not, activate it: `cd M:\\gliksbot\\backend && venv\\Scripts\\activate`.  \n2. Install the missing package if it is available in a repository:  \n   - `pip install dexter_brain` (if it is a public package).  \n   - If it is a local package, ensure it is installed in development mode:  \n     `pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain` (adjust path as needed).  \n3. If the package is part of the project, check the directory structure:  \n   - Ensure `dexter_brain` is a subdirectory in the project with an `__init__.py` and `sandbox.py` (or `sandbox/__init__.py`).  \n4. If steps above fail, check `sys.path` in Python to ensure the project root is included:  \n   - Add this to `main.py` before the import:  \n     ```python\n     import sys\n     sys.path.insert(0, 'M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\backend')\n     ```\n\n#### Permanent_Fix\n1. Use a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` to manage dependencies.  \n   - Example `requirements.txt`:  \n     ```\n     dexter_brain==1.0.0  # or use a Git URL if private\n     ```\n2. Automate environment setup with a script (e.g., `setup_env.bat` for Windows):  \n   ```bat\n   @echo off\n   cd /d M:\\gliksbot\\backend\n   python -m venv venv\n   call venv\\Scripts\\activate\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n3. Validate environment at startup by adding a check in `main.py`:  \n   ```python\n   try:\n       import dexter_brain\n   except ModuleNotFoundError:\n       print(\"ERROR: dexter_brain not installed. Run setup_env.bat first.\")\n       sys.exit(1)\n   ```\n\n#### Prevention\n1. Add a pre-startup validation script that checks for all required packages.  \n2. Use CI/CD pipelines to ensure dependencies are installed and tested before deployment.  \n3. Set up alerts for missing dependencies in logs.  \n\n#### Risk_Level: LOW  \nThe solution involves standard dependency management and environment checks, which are low-risk if implemented correctly.  \n\n#### Confidence: HIGH  \nThis is a common issue with well-established solutions in Python development.  \n\n---  \n**Collaboration Note**: If `dexter_brain` is a custom module, ensure the team confirms its location and installation method. If the module was renamed or deprecated, coordinate with the development team for updates."
