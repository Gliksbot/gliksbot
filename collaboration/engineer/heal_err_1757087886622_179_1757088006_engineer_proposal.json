  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `HEALING_TIMEOUT:error_healer` recurring three times in 10 minutes suggests that the error healing mechanism itself is timing out, indicating a potential infinite loop, resource exhaustion, or a dependency failure within the error handling subsystem. Given the context that this originates from `error_tracker`, it's likely that the healing process is either stuck trying to resolve a previous error (`err_1757087886622_178`) or is overwhelmed by the high volume of recent errors (120 errors, 2 critical). The absence of a stack trace implies the issue may be at a system or resource level rather than a code-level exception.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Mitigation**: Temporarily disable the automated healing for this specific error pattern to prevent cascading timeouts and free up system resources.\n2. **Root Cause Investigation**: Analyze logs and metrics around the time of the original error (`err_1757087886622_178`) to identify what is causing the healing process to hang or time out repeatedly.\n3. **Long-Term Solution**: Implement a circuit breaker pattern for the error healer to avoid infinite retries, along with better resource management and timeouts.\n4. **Prevention**: Enhance monitoring for the error healing subsystem, including metrics for healing attempt duration, success rates, and resource usage.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate Action** (execute now):\n```bash\n# Command to temporarily suspend healing for pattern 'HEALING_TIMEOUT:error_healer'\n$ curl -X POST http://error-tracker-api/management/healing/suspend \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"pattern\": \"HEALING_TIMEOUT:error_healer\", \"duration_minutes\": 30}'\n```\n\n**Permanent Fix** (code changes):\nAdd a circuit breaker to the error healer service (pseudo-code):\n```python\nclass ErrorHealer:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.circuit_breaker = CircuitBreaker(failure_threshold=3, recovery_timeout=300)\n\n    @self.circuit_breaker\n    def heal_error(self, error_id):\n        try:\n            # Existing healing logic with explicit timeout\n            result = self._heal_with_timeout(error_id, timeout_sec=30)\n            if not result:\n                raise HealingFailedException()\n            return result\n        except Exception as e:\n            log_healing_failure(error_id, e)\n            raise\n```\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Add Prometheus metrics to track healing duration and outcomes:\n  ```python\n  HEALING_DURATION = Histogram('healing_duration_seconds', 'Time spent healing errors')\n  HEALING_FAILURES = Counter('healing_failures_total', 'Total healing failures', ['error_pattern'])\n  ```\n- Set up an alert if healing failure rate exceeds 5% in 5 minutes or if average healing time exceeds 20 seconds.\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW (circuit breaker and monitoring are non-disruptive)  \n**Confidence**: HIGH (timeouts and circuit breakers are proven patterns for this scenario)"
