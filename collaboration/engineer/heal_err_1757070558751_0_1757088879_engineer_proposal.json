  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`, specifically when attempting to import `create_sandbox` from `dexter_brain.sandbox` during startup. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package in the current environment. Possible root causes include:\n- The package is not installed in the environment.\n- The package is installed but not on the Python path (e.g., incorrect virtual environment, misconfigured PYTHONPATH).\n- The package exists but is corrupted or incomplete.\n- There is a version mismatch or dependency issue.\n\nGiven the context (startup error, critical severity, and no prior context), the most likely cause is that the `dexter_brain` package is missing from the deployment environment or the runtime environment is misconfigured.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing package if it exists in a repository.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure the deployment process includes dependency installation and environment validation.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement pre-startup checks and better dependency management (e.g., using requirements.txt or Poetry).\n4. **Risk Assessment**: The fix is low-risk as it involves adding a missing dependency without altering existing code.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate_Action**: \n- Check if `dexter_brain` is available in your package index (e.g., PyPI or a private repo). If so, install it:\n  ```bash\n  pip install dexter_brain\n  ```\n- If it is a local package, ensure it is on the Python path or install it in development mode:\n  ```bash\n  pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain\n  ```\n- Verify the installation:\n  ```bash\n  python -c \"import dexter_brain; print('Module found')\"\n  ```\n\n**Permanent_Fix**:\n- Add `dexter_brain` to your `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`.\n- Use a virtual environment and ensure dependencies are installed during deployment:\n  ```bash\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  ```\n- Consider using a tool like Poetry or Pipenv for better dependency management.\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Add a pre-startup check in `main.py` to validate critical dependencies:\n  ```python\n  def check_dependencies():\n      required_modules = ['dexter_brain']\n      for module in required_modules:\n          try:\n              __import__(module)\n          except ImportError:\n              raise RuntimeError(f\"Missing required module: {module}\")\n  ```\n- Call this function before attempting to import any project-specific modules.\n- Set up CI/CD to run dependency checks and tests before deployment.\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH\n\nThis solution is safe, straightforward, and addresses the root cause without disrupting existing operations."
