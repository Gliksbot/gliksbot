  "content": "### Analysis\nThe `HEALING_TIMEOUT` error indicates that the `error_healer` subsystem itself is failing to complete error resolution within its allotted time, creating a recursive failure scenario. Given the context:\n- The original error (`err_1757077855002_38`) likely involves a complex or resource-intensive healing process.\n- The system shows elevated error counts (505 recent errors, 14 related timeouts), suggesting either systemic overload or a specific pathological case that the healer cannot handle efficiently.\n- The absence of a stack trace implies that the timeout may be occurring at a process or external resource level (e.g., database deadlock, external API call, infinite loop) rather than a code-level exception.\n\nRoot cause likely falls into one of:\n1. **Resource exhaustion**: The healing process for the original error is consuming excessive CPU, memory, or I/O, causing the timeout.\n2. **Blocking operations**: The healer is waiting on a locked resource or unresponsive external service.\n3. **Algorithmic complexity**: The healing logic for this specific error type has high time complexity, worsening under current system load.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate mitigation**: Implement a circuit breaker for the healing process to prevent recursive timeouts and allow the system to stabilize.\n2. **Investigation**: Enhance logging and diagnostics around the original error and healing attempts to identify the bottleneck.\n3. **Long-term fix**: Refactor the healing subsystem to use asynchronous, non-blocking operations with explicit timeouts and fallbacks.\n4. **Prevention**: Introduce better monitoring and alerting for healing process health, and add load shedding mechanisms.\n\n### Implementation\n\n**Immediate Action** (execute now):\n```bash\n# Temporarily disable healing for the problematic error type to break the cycle\ncurl -X POST http://error_healer/control/disable_healing \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"error_id\": \"err_1757077855002_38\", \"ttl\": 300}'\n\n# Increase healing timeout threshold as temporary measure\nexport HEALING_TIMEOUT_MS=60000  # Increase from default 30s to 60s\nsystemctl restart error_healer\n```\n\n**Permanent Fix** (code changes):\n```python\n# Revised healing service with async operations and timeouts\nasync def heal_error(error_id: str):\n    try:\n        # Wrap healing logic in timeout\n        healed = await asyncio.wait_for(\n            _execute_healing_strategy(error_id),\n            timeout=settings.HEALING_TIMEOUT\n        )\n        return healed\n    except asyncio.TimeoutError:\n        await _handle_healing_timeout(error_id)\n        raise HealingTimeoutError(f\"Healing timed out for {error_id}\")\n\nasync def _execute_healing_strategy(error_id: str):\n    # Implement with periodic progress checks\n    for step in healing_steps:\n        if await _is_too_slow():  # Monitor progress\n            raise HealingTimeoutError(\"Progress too slow\")\n        await step.execute()\n```\n\n**Prevention Measures**:\n1. Add Prometheus metrics for healing duration and success rate\n2. Implement alert when healing timeout rate exceeds 5%\n3. Add circuit breaker pattern to disable healing for specific error types after repeated failures\n\n**Risk_Level**: MEDIUM (temporary config changes are low risk, architectural changes require careful rollout)\n**Confidence**: HIGH (timeout patterns are well-understood, async solutions are proven)"
