  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during the startup of the application. This is a critical startup error, likely caused by:\n- The module not being installed in the current Python environment.\n- The module not being available in the Python path (e.g., incorrect working directory or missing `__init__.py`).\n- A version mismatch or dependency issue if the module exists but isn't properly configured.\n\nGiven the traceback points to `M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\main.py`, it's probable that the application relies on a local or proprietary package named `dexter_brain` which hasn't been deployed or installed correctly in this environment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the presence of `dexter_brain` in the environment and attempt a reinstall or path adjustment.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure the module is properly packaged and included in the deployment process, possibly using a requirements.txt or setup.py.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks during deployment to validate all dependencies are present before startup.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate_Action**:  \nRun the following in the backend directory to check for the module and install if missing:\n```bash\n# Check if dexter_brain is installed\npip list | grep dexter_brain\n\n# If not found, install it (assuming it's a package in the project)\npip install -e .  # if setup.py exists\n# OR manually add the path if it's a local module\nexport PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:M:/gliksbot/backend\"\n```\n\n**Permanent_Fix**:  \n- Create a `setup.py` or `requirements.txt` to include `dexter_brain` as a dependency.\n- Example `setup.py`:\n```python\nfrom setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\nsetup(\n    name=\"gliksbot\",\n    version=\"0.1\",\n    packages=find_packages(),\n    install_requires=[\n        # other dependencies\n    ],\n)\n```\n- Ensure the deployment script runs `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip install -e .`.\n\n**Prevention**:  \n- Add a pre-startup check in `main.py`:\n```python\ntry:\n    import dexter_brain\nexcept ImportError:\n    logging.critical(\"Missing dexter_brain module. Check installation.\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n```\n- Use CI/CD pipelines to validate dependencies before deployment.\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH"
