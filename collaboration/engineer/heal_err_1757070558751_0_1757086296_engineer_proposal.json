  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during the startup of the application (`main.py`, line 120). This is a common issue in Python applications and typically arises due to:\n- The module not being installed in the current environment.\n- The module not being available in the Python path.\n- A mismatch between the environment where the code is running and where dependencies are installed.\n\nGiven that this is a startup error and the system has reported multiple recent and critical errors, it is likely that there was a recent deployment or environment change that omitted this dependency, or the environment was not properly set up.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Mitigation**: Verify the environment and install the missing module if it exists, or check the codebase for the module's location.\n2. **Root Cause Resolution**: Ensure dependency management is robust, using a requirements.txt or a virtual environment to track and install dependencies.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks in the deployment pipeline to validate that all dependencies are satisfied before starting the application.\n\n### Implementation\n\n#### Immediate_Action\n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is a package that should be installed via pip. If so, install it:\n   ```bash\n   pip install dexter_brain\n   ```\n   If the package is not available on PyPI, it might be a local module. In that case, ensure the module is in the Python path or install it in development mode:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain\n   ```\n2. If `dexter_brain` is part of the project repository, ensure the project structure includes it and that the PYTHONPATH is set correctly. For example, if the project structure is:\n   ```\n   backend/\n      dexter_brain/\n         __init__.py\n         sandbox.py\n      main.py\n   ```\n   Then running from the `backend` directory should work. Alternatively, set PYTHONPATH:\n   ```bash\n   export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/backend:$PYTHONPATH\n   ```\n3. Restart the application after taking the above action.\n\n#### Permanent_Fix\n1. Use a `requirements.txt` file to list all dependencies, including `dexter_brain` if it is installable via pip. If it is a local package, consider packaging it properly or using a setup.py to install it.\n2. Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies and ensure consistency across deployments.\n3. In the startup code (`main.py`), add a check to validate critical dependencies at runtime and provide a meaningful error message if they are missing.\n\nExample code to check for module existence at startup:\n```python\ntry:\n    import dexter_brain\nexcept ModuleNotFoundError as e:\n    logging.critical(\"Missing required module: dexter_brain. Please install it.\")\n    raise\n```\n\n#### Prevention\n1. Include dependency checks in the CI/CD pipeline. For example, in a GitHub Action, you could have a step that runs:\n   ```yaml\n   - name: Install dependencies\n     run: pip install -r requirements.txt\n   - name: Verify imports\n     run: python -c \"import dexter_brain\"\n   ```\n2. Use tools like `pip check` to verify that all dependencies are satisfied.\n3. Monitor the system for ModuleNotFoundError and alert the team immediately.\n\n#### Risk_Level\n**LOW**: The proposed solutions are standard practices for Python dependency management and pose minimal risk if implemented correctly.\n\n#### Confidence\n**HIGH**: This is a common issue with well-established solutions in the Python ecosystem.\n\n### Collaboration\nI recommend the team reviews the project structure and dependency management process to ensure such errors are caught early in the development and deployment lifecycle."
