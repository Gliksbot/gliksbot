  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` indicating that the Python module `dexter_brain` is missing when the system attempts to import it during startup. This typically occurs because:\n- The module is not installed in the current Python environment.\n- The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect directory structure or missing `__init__.py`).\n- There might be a version mismatch or dependency issue.\n\nGiven the context (startup error, critical severity, and no prior context), the most probable root cause is that the `dexter_brain` package is either not installed or not properly configured in the deployment environment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the installation status of `dexter_brain` and install it if missing.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure the module is included in dependency management (e.g., `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`) and automate environment setup.\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks during deployment to validate all dependencies are present before startup.\n4. **Risk Assessment**: The proposed solution is low-risk as it involves standard dependency management practices.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate Action Steps:**\n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is installed:\n   ```bash\n   pip list | grep dexter_brain\n   ```\n2. If not installed, install it:\n   ```bash\n   pip install dexter_brain\n   ```\n   (If `dexter_brain` is a local module, ensure it is in the Python path or install it in editable mode: `pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain`)\n\n**Permanent Fix:**\n1. Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`:\n   ```txt\n   # requirements.txt\n   dexter_brain==1.0.0  # specify version if known\n   ```\n2. Use a virtual environment and ensure dependencies are installed during deployment:\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n**Prevention:**\n1. Add a pre-startup check in `main.py` to validate critical dependencies:\n   ```python\n   def check_dependencies():\n       try:\n           import dexter_brain\n       except ModuleNotFoundError:\n           logging.critical(\"Dependency 'dexter_brain' is missing. Please install it.\")\n           sys.exit(1)\n   ```\n2. Integrate dependency checks into CI/CD pipelines to catch issues before deployment.\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH"
