  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package during the import in `main.py`. The root cause is likely one of the following:\n- The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the current Python environment.\n- The package is installed but not on the Python path (e.g., incorrect virtual environment, misconfigured PYTHONPATH).\n- There is a typo or naming inconsistency in the import statement or the package itself.\n- The package exists but is corrupted or incomplete.\n\nGiven the context (startup error, no prior context available), the most probable cause is that the required package is missing from the environment where the application is running.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Verify Installation**: Check if `dexter_brain` is installed in the active Python environment.\n2. **Install Missing Package**: If not installed, install it using the appropriate method (e.g., pip, from source).\n3. **Validate Path and Environment**: Ensure the correct Python environment is activated and the package is accessible.\n4. **Test the Fix**: Run the application to confirm the error is resolved.\n\nSince this is a critical startup error, the immediate action should focus on installing the missing module. For a permanent fix, we should ensure the dependency is properly managed (e.g., via requirements.txt or environment setup scripts). Prevention involves adding checks for dependencies at startup and using dependency management tools.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate Action** (execute these steps in the system environment):\n```bash\n# Activate the correct virtual environment if used (e.g., for Windows)\nM:\\gliksbot\\backend\\venv\\Scripts\\activate\n\n# Install the dexter_brain package via pip (assuming it is available on PyPI or a private index)\npip install dexter_brain\n\n# If not on PyPI, install from a local path or VCS (e.g., Git)\n# pip install git+https://github.com/your-org/dexter_brain.git@main\n\n# Alternatively, if there is a requirements.txt, install all dependencies\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# After installation, test the import in Python to validate\npython -c \"from dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox; print('Import successful')\"\n```\n\n**Permanent Fix**:\n- Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` (if not already present) with the correct version.\n- Use a virtual environment and ensure the deployment process includes installing dependencies from `requirements.txt`.\n- For production, consider using Docker to encapsulate the environment and dependencies.\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Add a startup check in `main.py` to validate critical dependencies before proceeding:\n  ```python\n  try:\n      from dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox\n  except ModuleNotFoundError as e:\n      logging.critical(f\"Missing required dependency: {e}\")\n      sys.exit(1)\n  ```\n- Implement CI/CD checks that run `pip check` or validate dependencies before deployment.\n- Use dependency management tools like `pipenv` or `poetry` for better environment consistency.\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH\n\nThis solution is low-risk because it only involves installing a missing package, which is a standard operation. The confidence is high as the error clearly points to a missing module, and installing it should resolve the issue. If the package is not available, the error will persist, but that would indicate a larger issue with dependency availability."
