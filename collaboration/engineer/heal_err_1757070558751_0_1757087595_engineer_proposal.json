  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package during the import in `main.py` at line 120. The root cause is likely one of the following:\n- The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the current Python environment.\n- The package is installed but not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect virtual environment, missing `__init__.py`, or misconfigured `PYTHONPATH`).\n- The package exists but has been corrupted or partially deleted.\n- There is a version mismatch or dependency issue.\n\nGiven the context of a startup error in a backend system (`gliksbot/backend`), it is probable that the deployment or environment setup is incomplete or misconfigured.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the environment and install the missing package if it exists in a repository.\n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure the environment is reproducible using a dependency management tool (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `pipenv`, or `poetry`).\n3. **Prevention**: Implement checks in the startup script to validate all dependencies before proceeding, and use CI/CD to test the environment setup.\n\n### Implementation\n#### Immediate_Action:\n1. Check if `dexter_brain` is available in the project or a package index:\n   ```bash\n   pip list | grep dexter_brain\n   ```\n   If not found, attempt to install it. If it is a local package, ensure it is installed in editable mode or added to the path.\n2. If the package is local, navigate to its directory and install it:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain\n   ```\n3. Verify the Python path and environment activation.\n\n#### Permanent_Fix:\n1. Create or update `requirements.txt` to include `dexter_brain` (with version pinning if applicable).\n2. Use a virtual environment and ensure all dependencies are installed via:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n3. If `dexter_brain` is a local module, structure it as a proper package with `setup.py` and install it in development mode.\n\n#### Prevention:\n1. Add a pre-startup check in `main.py`:\n   ```python\n   try:\n       import dexter_brain\n   except ModuleNotFoundError:\n       logging.critical(\"dexter_brain not installed. Exiting.\")\n       sys.exit(1)\n   ```\n2. Integrate dependency checks into CI/CD pipelines to catch missing modules early.\n\n#### Risk_Level: LOW\nThe solution involves standard dependency management practices with minimal risk.\n\n#### Confidence: HIGH\nThis is a common issue with well-established solutions in Python environments."
