  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module when attempting to import it in `main.py` at line 120. This is a common issue in Python applications and typically arises due to one of the following root causes:\n\n1. **Missing Dependency**: The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the current Python environment.\n2. **Path Issue**: The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect working directory or misconfigured module structure).\n3. **Version Mismatch**: The installed version of `dexter_brain` is incompatible or corrupted.\n4. **Environment Configuration**: The virtual environment or interpreter settings are misconfigured, leading to isolation from required packages.\n\nGiven the context (startup error, critical severity, and no additional context), the most probable cause is that the `dexter_brain` package is missing from the environment where the application is running.\n\n### Approach\nTo resolve this, we will:\n1. **Immediately verify and install the missing package** to restore system functionality.\n2. **Implement dependency management best practices** to prevent recurrence.\n3. **Enhance error handling and logging** for better diagnostics in the future.\n\nThis approach minimizes disruption by focusing on quick recovery followed by robust, long-term fixes.\n\n### Implementation\n\n#### Immediate_Action\n1. **Check for `dexter_brain` in the environment**:\n   - Open a terminal in the environment where the application runs (e.g., activate the virtual environment if used).\n   - Run: `pip list | grep dexter_brain` (or `pip freeze | findstr dexter_brain` on Windows) to check if the package is installed.\n2. **Install the package**:\n   - If not found, install it via pip: `pip install dexter_brain`.\n   - If the package is private or not on PyPI, install from a source (e.g., `pip install git+<repository_url>` or from a local wheel).\n3. **Restart the application** and verify the error is resolved.\n\n#### Permanent_Fix\n1. **Use a requirements.txt or pyproject.toml** to declare dependencies explicitly.\n   - Example `requirements.txt` entry: `dexter_brain==1.0.0` (specify the correct version).\n2. **Automate dependency installation** in the startup script or deployment process:\n   - Add `pip install -r requirements.txt` to your startup sequence.\n3. **Use a virtual environment** to isolate dependencies and ensure consistency across environments.\n\n#### Prevention\n1. **Add pre-startup checks** in `main.py` to validate critical dependencies:\n   ```python\n   def check_dependencies():\n       required = {'dexter_brain'}\n       installed = {pkg.key for pkg in pkg_resources.working_set}\n       missing = required - installed\n       if missing:\n           raise RuntimeError(f\"Missing dependencies: {missing}\")\n   ```\n   Call this function before attempting to import `dexter_brain`.\n2. **Implement better logging** to capture dependency issues early.\n3. **Use CI/CD pipelines** to test installations in a staging environment before deployment.\n\n#### Risk_Level\n**LOW**: Installing a missing package is a standard operation with minimal risk. The changes to startup checks are non-disruptive and improve resilience.\n\n#### Confidence\n**HIGH**: This is a well-understood issue in Python ecosystems, and the solution is straightforward and proven.\n\n---\n**Collaboration Note**: This solution focuses on rapid recovery and sustainable practices. If the `dexter_brain` module is custom/internal, ensure the installation source is accessible and secure."
