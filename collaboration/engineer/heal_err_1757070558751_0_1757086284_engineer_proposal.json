  "content": "### Analysis\nThe error is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `dexter_brain`, specifically when attempting to import `create_sandbox` from `dexter_brain.sandbox` during system startup. This indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` package in the current environment. The root cause is likely one of the following:\n- The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the environment.\n- The package is installed but not on the Python path (e.g., incorrect virtual environment, misconfigured PYTHONPATH).\n- There is a version mismatch or corruption in the package installation.\n- The import statement in `main.py` (line 120) has an incorrect module path.\n\nGiven the context (startup error, no prior context available), the most probable cause is a missing package due to incomplete environment setup or dependency installation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Verify Environment**: Check if the Python environment (virtual environment, conda, etc.) is activated and correct.\n2. **Check Installation**: Confirm if `dexter_brain` is installed. If not, install it using the appropriate method (pip, from source, etc.).\n3. **Validate Path**: Ensure the package is on the Python path. This might involve checking `sys.path` or environment variables like `PYTHONPATH`.\n4. **Correct Import**: If the package structure is different, adjust the import statement accordingly.\n5. **Automate Prevention**: Implement checks in the startup script to validate critical dependencies before attempting to use them.\n\n### Implementation\n**Immediate Action**:\n1. Activate the correct Python environment (e.g., `source venv/bin/activate` on Unix, `venv\\Scripts\\activate` on Windows).\n2. Install the missing package. If it's available on PyPI or a private index, run:\n   ```bash\n   pip install dexter_brain\n   ```\n   If it's a local package, install it from the source directory:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain\n   ```\n3. Restart the application. If the error persists, check the package location with:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   print(sys.path)\n   ```\n   and ensure the path to `dexter_brain` is included.\n\n**Permanent Fix**:\n- Maintain a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` with all dependencies, including `dexter_brain`.\n- Use a virtual environment and ensure the startup script explicitly activates it.\n- In `main.py`, add a pre-startup check to validate critical imports:\n   ```python\n   def check_dependencies():\n       required_modules = ['dexter_brain']\n       for module in required_modules:\n           try:\n               __import__(module)\n           except ImportError:\n               raise RuntimeError(f\"Critical dependency {module} is missing. Please install it.\")\n   \n   # Call this function before startup_event\n   check_dependencies()\n   ```\n- Consider using a dependency management tool like `pipenv` or `poetry` to handle environments and installations reliably.\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Implement a CI/CD pipeline that runs dependency checks and tests before deployment.\n- Use logging or monitoring to alert on missing dependencies during startup.\n- Document the environment setup process clearly to avoid human error.\n\n**Risk Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH\n\nThis solution is low-risk because it involves standard dependency management practices and does not alter core application logic. The immediate action is reversible and non-destructive."
