  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to parse through that first. The error is a STARTUP_ERROR with the message \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". The stack trace points to a line in main.py trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nHmm, the root cause here is probably a missing module. The system is trying to import 'dexter_brain', which isn't installed or not in the Python path. Since it's a startup error, the module is required for the application to start. \n\nImmediate action would be to check if the module exists in the environment. If not, install it. But maybe the module is a custom one, not available on PyPI. So the user might need to ensure that the module is present in the project directory or installed correctly. Also, checking the Python path to make sure it's included.\n\nFor a permanent fix, the solution would involve ensuring the module is properly installed and available. If it's a third-party module, installing via pip. If it's part of the project, maybe the directory structure is incorrect, so adjusting the imports or the project layout. Also, setting up a virtual environment might help manage dependencies better.\n\nPrevention could involve adding checks during the build or startup process to verify all required modules are present. Maybe implementing a dependency check script that runs before starting the application. Also, using tools like pip freeze to ensure all dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.\n\nRisk assessment: The immediate action of installing a module might have a medium risk if the module isn't compatible with other dependencies. The permanent fix of adjusting the project structure could be low risk if done correctly. Prevention steps like dependency checks are low risk and beneficial.\n\nWait, the error is in the backend's main.py. So the 'dexter_brain' module should be part of the project. Maybe the import path is incorrect. For example, if the module is in a subdirectory, the import might need to be relative or the package structure might be missing __init__.py files. Checking the directory structure and ensuring that the package is properly set up.\n\nSo, possible steps: Check if 'dexter_brain' exists in the project, verify its location, ensure it's included in the Python path, and that there are no typos in the import statement. If it's a missing package, install it or add it to the project.\n\nIn the implementation, the user might need to run pip install if it's a third-party package, or adjust the import statements if it's a local module. Also, checking for virtual environment activation and correct interpreter path.\n\nI should structure the answer into Analysis, Approach, and Implementation as per the user's request. Make sure each section addresses the points required. Also, check if any new skills are needed, but in this case, it's standard Python troubleshooting, so probably no new skill specs required.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., located in a subdirectory not recognized as a package).  \n3. **Typo/Misnaming**: A typo in the module name or incorrect import path (e.g., missing `__init__.py` in the package directory).  \n\n**Context**:  \nThe error occurs in `main.py` during the `startup_event`, suggesting `dexter_brain` is a critical dependency for system initialization.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Immediate Action**:  \n   - Verify the existence and location of the `dexter_brain` module.  \n   - Ensure the Python environment has the module installed or the correct path configured.  \n   - Check for typos or structural issues in the import statement.  \n\n2. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Install the module (if missing) or adjust the project structure to include it in the Python path.  \n   - Implement dependency management (e.g., `requirements.txt`) to ensure consistency.  \n\n3. **Prevention**:  \n   - Add pre-startup checks to validate critical dependencies.  \n   - Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies and avoid path conflicts.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### **1. Immediate Action**  \n**Steps**:  \n1. **Check Module Existence**:  \n   - Navigate to the project directory and verify if `dexter_brain` exists as a folder or installed package.  \n   - Run `dir M:\\gliksbot\\backend` (or equivalent) to check for the module.  \n\n2. **Test Import Manually**:  \n   - Open a Python shell in the project directory and run:  \n     ```python  \n     import dexter_brain  \n     ```  \n   - If this fails, the module is missing or misconfigured.  \n\n3. **Install or Link Module**:  \n   - If missing, install via pip (if publicly available):  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install dexter_brain  \n     ```  \n   - If it’s a local module, ensure it’s in the project root or add its path:  \n     ```python  \n     import sys  \n     sys.path.append(\"M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\backend\")  # Adjust path as needed  \n     ```  \n\n4. **Check for Typos**:  \n   - Confirm the module name matches exactly (case-sensitive) and includes `__init__.py` if it’s a package.  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Permanent Fix**  \n**Solution**:  \n- **Option A (Third-Party Module)**:  \n  Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` and install:  \n  ```bash  \n  echo \"dexter_brain==<version>\" >> requirements.txt  \n  pip install -r requirements.txt  \n  ```  \n\n- **Option B (Local Module)**:  \n  Ensure the project structure includes `dexter_brain` as a package:  \n  ```  \n  M:\\gliksbot\\backend  \n  ├── main.py  \n  └── dexter_brain  \n      ├── __init__.py  \n      └── sandbox.py  \n  ```  \n  Adjust imports to use relative paths if necessary.  \n\n**Implementation Details**:  \n- Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:  \n  ```bash  \n  python -m venv venv  \n  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate  \n  pip install -r requirements.txt  \n  ```  \n\n---\n\n#### **3. Prevention**  \n- **Pre-Startup Dependency Check**:  \n  Add a script to validate critical modules before launching the app:  \n  ```python  \n  # check_dependencies.py  \n  try:  \n      import dexter_brain  \n  except ImportError:  \n      raise RuntimeError(\"Critical dependency 'dexter_brain' missing!\")  \n  ```  \n  Run this script during startup.  \n\n- **Monitoring**:  \n  - Set up alerts for `ModuleNotFoundError` in logs.  \n  - Use tools like `pip-check` to detect missing dependencies:  \n    ```bash  \n    pip install pip-check  \n    pip-check  \n    ```  \n\n---\n\n#### **Risk Assessment**  \n- **Risk Level**: **LOW**  \n  - Installing a missing module or adjusting paths is low-risk if tested in a staging environment.  \n  - Dependency checks add minimal overhead.  \n\n- **Confidence**: **HIGH**  \n  - The solution directly addresses the root cause (missing module) and aligns with standard Python practices.  \n\n---\n\n### Final Proposal  \n**Collaboration Session ID**: heal_err_1757070558751_0_1757087341  \n**Vote**: ✅ Approved (Balances speed, safety, and correctness).  \n\n**Next Steps**:  \n1. Execute Immediate Action steps to resolve the error.  \n2. Implement Permanent Fix and Prevention measures in the next deployment cycle."
