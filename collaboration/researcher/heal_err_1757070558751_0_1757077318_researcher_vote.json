  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a ModuleNotFoundError for 'dexter_brain' when starting up their system. The error is critical, so I need to figure out why Python can't find that module.\n\nFirst, the root cause. The error message says \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means the module isn't installed in the current Python environment, or the Python path isn't set up correctly. Since it's happening during startup, maybe the module is part of the project but not properly included in the environment. Alternatively, the module might be missing from the system's installed packages.\n\nLooking at the stack trace, the error occurs in main.py line 120 when trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox. So the code is expecting that module to exist. If the project uses a virtual environment, maybe it's not activated, or the module wasn't installed there. Or perhaps the module is in a different directory that's not in the PYTHONPATH.\n\nImmediate actions would involve checking if the module is installed. The user could run pip install dexter_brain if it's a third-party package. But if it's a local module, they might need to ensure the directory containing it is in the Python path. Alternatively, maybe the project structure has changed, and the module isn't where it's supposed to be.\n\nFor a permanent fix, if the module is part of the project, they should include it in the source distribution. Using a setup.py or pyproject.toml to package it properly. If it's a third-party module, adding it to requirements.txt and ensuring it's installed in the correct environment. Also, checking the import statements to make sure they're correct.\n\nPrevention steps could include setting up automated testing that checks for missing modules, using virtual environments consistently, and ensuring that all dependencies are properly listed and installed. Monitoring for import errors during deployment could catch this earlier.\n\nRisks of the solution: If installing a new package, there might be version conflicts. If modifying the Python path, it could lead to other issues if not done correctly. Confidence would depend on whether the module is known to be present or not. If it's a local module, the fix is more straightforward, but if it's a missing third-party package, that's a different approach.\n\nSo putting it all together, the root cause is the missing module. Immediate action is to check installation and paths. Permanent fix is to ensure the module is properly included in the project's dependencies and environment. Prevention through dependency management and testing. Risk level would be medium if installing new packages, but low if just adjusting paths. Confidence high if the module exists and just needs to be installed.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because Python cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. The module is not installed in the active Python environment  \n2. The module's directory is not in the PYTHONPATH  \n3. The module is part of the project but improperly structured  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' is a local module or third-party package  \n2. If third-party: Run `pip install dexter_brain` in the project's virtual environment  \n3. If local:  \n   a. Confirm 'dexter_brain' directory exists in project root  \n   b. Add its path to PYTHONPATH: `export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/project:$PYTHONPATH`  \n   c. Alternatively, create symlink in site-packages: `ln -s /path/to/dexter_brain /venv/lib/python3.x/site-packages/`  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. For third-party packages: Add to requirements.txt and ensure pip-sync is used  \n2. For local modules:  \n   a. Create setup.py with proper package structure  \n   b. Install in development mode: `pip install -e .`  \n   c. Ensure __init__.py exists in dexter_brain directory  \n3. Implement dependency validation in CI/CD pipeline  \n\nPrevention:  \n1. Add pre-startup check script to verify critical modules exist  \n2. Use virtual environment isolation with requirements pinning  \n3. Implement automated testing for import functionality  \n4. Monitor for ModuleNotFoundError patterns in logs  \n\nRisk_Level: MEDIUM (Potential for dependency conflicts during installation)  \nConfidence: HIGH (Standard Python module resolution issue with clear solutions)  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
