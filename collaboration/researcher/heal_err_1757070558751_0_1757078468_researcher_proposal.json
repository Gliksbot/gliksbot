  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The error message says \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". So, the system is trying to import a module called dexter_brain during startup, but it can't find it. That's a Python error, right? ModuleNotFoundError usually means that the required package isn't installed in the environment where the code is running.\n\nLooking at the stack trace, the error occurs in main.py line 120 when trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox. So the code is expecting this module to be present. The immediate thought is that the dexter_brain package isn't installed in the Python environment that's running the backend.\n\nThe system status shows recent errors and critical errors, so this might be a recurring issue. The mission is to diagnose and fix it. Let's break down the analysis.\n\nRoot cause: The module dexter_brain isn't installed in the current Python environment. Alternatively, it might be installed in a different environment or not at all. Another possibility is that the module is present but not in the Python path, but that's less common if the setup is standard.\n\nImmediate action: Install the missing module. But how? The user might need to run pip install dexter_brain, but if it's a private package, they might need to install it from a specific source. Alternatively, if the module is part of the project, maybe it's not properly linked. For example, if the project has a local package named dexter_brain that's not installed in development mode.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure that the dexter_brain package is correctly installed in the environment. If it's a third-party package, add it to the requirements.txt. If it's a local package, use pip install -e . or similar to install it in editable mode. Also, check the project structure to make sure the package is in the right location.\n\nPrevention: Implement dependency checks during deployment, use virtual environments, and ensure that all required packages are listed in the project's dependencies. Maybe add a check in the startup script to verify that all necessary modules are present before proceeding.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing package is low if it's a known dependency. However, if the package isn't available or has compatibility issues, that could cause more problems. Also, if the package is not supposed to be there, maybe it's a sign of a larger issue.\n\nWait, but the error is happening on startup, so the system can't even initialize. So the immediate action would be to install the missing module. But how does the user know where to get it from? If it's a private package, they might need to clone a repository and install it. If it's a public package, pip install should work. But the error message doesn't specify, so the solution should cover both possibilities.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the Python path is incorrect. The code might be running in an environment where the current directory or the package directory isn't in the sys.path. But that's less likely if the project is structured properly. Still, checking the PYTHONPATH environment variable could be part of the troubleshooting.\n\nSo, putting it all together. The analysis would be that the module is missing. Immediate action is to install it. Permanent fix is to ensure it's included in the dependencies. Prevention would involve checks and proper environment setup.\n\nNow, for the implementation steps. The user needs specific commands. If it's a third-party package, pip install dexter_brain. If it's a local package, navigate to the directory and run pip install -e . or install from a requirements file. Also, checking the requirements.txt to make sure it's listed.\n\nBut since the context isn't available, the solution should cover possible scenarios. Also, considering that the system is in healing mode, the immediate action should be quick and non-disruptive. Installing the package is straightforward if it's available.\n\nRisk level would be low because installing a missing dependency is a standard procedure. Confidence is high because the error message clearly points to the missing module.\n\nSo the final answer should structure all these points into the required sections.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python environment lacks the required `dexter_brain` package or module. This could occur due to:  \n1. Missing installation of the package.  \n2. Incorrect Python environment (e.g., virtual environment not activated).  \n3. `dexter_brain` is a local/custom module not properly linked or installed.  \n\n**Immediate Action**:  \n1. Verify the Python environment (e.g., check if a virtual environment is active).  \n2. Install the missing module via `pip install dexter_brain` (if publicly available).  \n3. If `dexter_brain` is a local package, ensure it is installed in development mode (`pip install -e .`) or added to `PYTHONPATH`.  \n\n**Permanent Fix**:  \n1. **For third-party packages**: Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` and ensure it is installed during deployment.  \n2. **For local/custom packages**:  \n   - Structure the project to include `dexter_brain` as a package (with `__init__.py`).  \n   - Use `pip install -e .` in the project root to install it in editable mode.  \n   - Alternatively, add the package directory to `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.  \n\n**Prevention**:  \n1. **Dependency Checks**:  \n   - Add a pre-startup script to validate all required modules are installed (e.g., `import dexter_brain` in a test script).  \n   - Use tools like `pip-check` to verify dependencies.  \n2. **Environment Consistency**:  \n   - Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to lock dependencies.  \n   - Deploy with virtual environments or containers (e.g., Docker) to ensure environment parity.  \n3. **Monitoring**:  \n   - Implement logging for missing modules during startup.  \n   - Set up alerts for `ModuleNotFoundError` in monitoring tools (e.g., Sentry, Prometheus).  \n\n**Risk Assessment**:  \n- **Risk Level**: LOW  \n  - Installing missing dependencies is a standard procedure.  \n  - Risks arise only if `dexter_brain` is incompatible or malicious (mitigated by verifying package sources).  \n- **Confidence**: HIGH  \n  - The error message directly points to the missing module, making the solution straightforward.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Diagnose Environment**: Confirm the active Python environment and installed packages.  \n2. **Install Missing Module**: Use `pip` to install `dexter_brain` or link the local package.  \n3. **Validate Fix**: Restart the service and check for recurrence.  \n4. **Prevent Recurrence**: Update deployment pipelines and monitoring.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### 1. Immediate Action (Mitigation)  \n```bash  \n# Check active Python environment  \nwhich python  \n\n# List installed packages  \npip list  \n\n# Install the missing module (if public)  \npip install dexter_brain  \n\n# If local package: Navigate to project root and install in dev mode  \ncd /path/to/project  \npip install -e .  \n\n# Alternatively, add the package directory to PYTHONPATH  \nexport PYTHONPATH=/path/to/dexter_brain:$PYTHONPATH  \n```  \n\n#### 2. Permanent Fix (Code/Deployment Changes)  \n**For Third-Party Packages**:  \nAdd to `requirements.txt`:  \n```  \ndexter_brain==<version>  \n```  \n\n**For Local Packages**:  \nEnsure project structure includes `dexter_brain` as a package:  \n```  \nproject_root/  \n├── dexter_brain/  \n│   ├── __init__.py  \n│   └── sandbox.py  \n├── backend/  \n│   └── main.py  \n└── requirements.txt  \n```  \n\nInstall in editable mode:  \n```bash  \npip install -e .  \n```  \n\n#### 3. Prevention (Monitoring/Alerts)  \nAdd a pre-startup check script (`pre_start.sh`):  \n```bash  \n#!/bin/bash  \npython -c \"import dexter_brain\" || { echo \"Missing module: dexter_brain\"; exit 1; }  \nexec python backend/main.py  \n```  \n\nUpdate deployment pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to include dependency checks:  \n```yaml  \njobs:  \n  deploy:  \n    steps:  \n      - name: Check dependencies  \n        run: python -c \"import dexter_brain\"  \n```  \n\n---\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (Optional)  \nIf the team lacks Python environment management skills, define a skill specification:  \n```  \nSKILL_SPEC: Python Environment Management  \n- Ability to manage virtual environments (venv, virtualenv)  \n- Knowledge of pip, requirements.txt, and pip-tools  \n- Experience with PYTHONPATH and module resolution  \n- Familiarity with containerization (Docker) for environment consistency  \n```  \n\nThis solution balances rapid resolution (immediate action) with long-term stability (permanent fix and prevention)."
