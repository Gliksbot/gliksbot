  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a STARTUP_ERROR because the module 'dexter_brain' isn't found. The error occurs in main.py line 120 when trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox. \n\nFirst, the root cause. The most likely reason is that the 'dexter_brain' package isn't installed in the Python environment where the application is running. Alternatively, the package might be installed but not in the correct directory, or there's an issue with the Python path.\n\nImmediate action: They need to check if the package is installed. They can run 'pip show dexter_brain' to see if it's present. If not, installing it via pip might fix it. But maybe the package isn't available on PyPI, so they might need to install it from a local directory or a specific source. Also, checking the Python environment to ensure it's the correct one, especially if they're using virtual environments.\n\nPermanent fix: If the package is missing, installing it properly. If it's a local package, ensuring it's in the right location and added to the Python path. Maybe setting up a requirements.txt file to manage dependencies so that the environment is consistent. Also, checking the code for any typos in the import statement.\n\nPrevention: Implementing dependency management, like using virtual environments and requirements files. Adding checks during deployment to ensure all dependencies are installed. Maybe integrating a linter or a tool that checks for missing imports during development. Also, monitoring for missing modules in the logs.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a new package could be medium if it introduces conflicts with existing packages. But since the system isn't starting, the immediate risk is high. However, installing the correct package should resolve it. If the package isn't available, there might be a need to look into alternative solutions or check the source code for the module.\n\nSo putting it all together, the analysis would be that the module is missing. Immediate action is to install the package. Permanent fix is to ensure dependencies are managed. Prevention through better dependency tracking. Risk level medium.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because the Python module 'dexter_brain' is missing from the environment. This is likely due to incomplete dependency installation, incorrect Python path configuration, or a missing local package.  \nImmediate_Action: 1. Verify Python environment: Run `which python` (Linux/macOS) or `Get-Command python` (PowerShell) to confirm the active environment. 2. Check for the module: Run `pip show dexter_brain` to see if it's installed. 3. Install the module: If missing, install via `pip install dexter_brain` (if available on PyPI) or install from a local directory (e.g., `pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain`).  \nPermanent_Fix: 1. Ensure dependencies are declared in `requirements.txt` and install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 2. If 'dexter_brain' is a local/internal package, add its directory to `PYTHONPATH` or install it in development mode (`pip install -e .`). 3. Validate environment setup in CI/CD pipelines to ensure consistency.  \nPrevention: 1. Implement dependency checks in deployment scripts. 2. Use virtual environments (e.g., `venv`) to isolate dependencies. 3. Add pre-startup validation (e.g., `python -c \"import dexter_brain\"` in startup scripts).  \nRisk_Level: MEDIUM (Potential for dependency conflicts during installation, but critical to resolve for system functionality).  \nConfidence: HIGH  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
