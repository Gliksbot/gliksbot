  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a ModuleNotFoundError for 'dexter_brain' when starting up their system. The error is a startup error, critical severity, and it's happening during the import in main.py line 120. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out why Python can't find the 'dexter_brain' module. Common reasons for this are the module not being installed, not being in the right directory, or there's an issue with the Python path.\n\nLooking at the context, the error occurs in the backend part of the application. The file path is M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\main.py. So the project structure might have 'dexter_brain' as a local module that's supposed to be in the same environment. Maybe the module isn't installed in the current Python environment. Alternatively, the working directory might not be set correctly when running the script, so Python isn't looking in the right place for the module.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if 'dexter_brain' is installed. If it's a third-party package, installing it via pip would help. But if it's a local module, then the directory structure might be the issue. The user should verify that 'dexter_brain' is present in the project directory or in a location that's part of the PYTHONPATH.\n\nFor a permanent fix, ensuring that the module is properly installed or that the Python path includes the necessary directories. If it's a local module, adding the parent directory to sys.path in the code or setting the PYTHONPATH environment variable could resolve it. Alternatively, if it's a package, installing it in the environment using setup.py or pip.\n\nPrevention would involve setting up proper environment configurations, using virtual environments, and ensuring that all dependencies are listed in a requirements.txt file. Also, monitoring for missing modules during deployment or startup could catch such issues early.\n\nRisks of the solution: If modifying the Python path, there might be unintended consequences if other modules are overshadowed. Installing a package might introduce version conflicts. So the risk level would be medium.\n\nI should also check if there are any related errors. The system status shows 2 related startup errors, so maybe this is a recurring issue. Ensuring that the environment is consistent across deployments (like using Docker) could help prevent this.\n\nSo putting it all together, the root cause is likely that the 'dexter_brain' module isn't available in the Python environment or the path isn't set correctly. Immediate action is to install the module or adjust the path. Permanent fix would be to ensure the environment is set up correctly, maybe by installing the package or adjusting the project structure. Prevention through environment management and monitoring. Risk is medium.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because Python cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. The module is not installed in the current Python environment  \n2. The module's directory is not in the PYTHONPATH  \n3. The module is a local package that hasn't been properly installed or linked  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' is a third-party package:  \n   ```bash\n   pip install dexter-brain  # If available as PyPI package\n   ```  \n2. If it's a local module:  \n   - Confirm 'dexter_brain' directory exists in project root (peer to 'backend')  \n   - Add parent directory to PYTHONPATH:  \n     ```bash\n     set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;M:\\gliksbot\n     ```  \n3. Alternatively, install local package in development mode:  \n   ```bash\n   pip install -e M:\\gliksbot\n   ```  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. If third-party package:  \n   - Add to requirements.txt:  \n     ```txt\n     dexter-brain==<version>\n     ```  \n   - Ensure environment is recreated with `pip install -r requirements.txt`  \n2. If local module:  \n   - Modify main.py to add path programmatically:  \n     ```python\n     import sys\n     sys.path.append(r'M:\\gliksbot')\n     ```  \n   - Or create setup.py in 'dexter_brain' and install as package  \n\nPrevention:  \n- Implement dependency checking in CI/CD pipeline  \n- Use virtual environments with pinned dependencies  \n- Add pre-startup script to validate module availability  \n- Monitor for ModuleNotFoundError patterns in logs  \n\nRisk_Level: MEDIUM  \n(Incorrect path modifications could cause module conflicts; installation risks version mismatches)  \n\nConfidence: HIGH  \n(Solution addresses all common causes of missing module errors)  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
