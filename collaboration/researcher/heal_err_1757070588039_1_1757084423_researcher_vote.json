  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a ModuleNotFoundError for 'dexter_brain' when starting up their system. The error is a startup error, critical severity. The stack trace points to main.py trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nFirst, root cause. The most likely reason is that the 'dexter_brain' module isn't installed in the Python environment where the application is running. Alternatively, it might not be in the right directory, or there's a typo in the import statement. Since the error is during startup, it's probably a missing dependency.\n\nImmediate action: They need to check if the module exists. If it's a third-party package, installing it via pip would help. If it's a local module, ensuring it's in the Python path. Maybe the virtual environment isn't activated, so checking that is important. Also, checking for typos in the import statement.\n\nPermanent fix: If it's a third-party package, adding it to the requirements.txt so it's installed automatically. If it's a local module, making sure the directory is included in the PYTHONPATH or setting up the project structure correctly. Maybe creating a setup.py to package the module properly.\n\nPrevention: Implementing dependency management, like using virtual environments and requirements files. Adding checks in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure all dependencies are installed. Monitoring for missing modules during deployment. Maybe a linter or static analysis tool to catch import errors before deployment.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing package is low if it's a known dependency. If the module is supposed to be present but isn't, there might be a configuration issue. The risk of changing the Python path could introduce other issues if not done carefully. Confidence in the solution depends on correctly identifying whether it's a missing package or a path issue.\n\nSo, putting this all together. The answer should outline these points clearly. The immediate action would be to install the package or adjust the path. Permanent fix is ensuring dependencies are managed. Prevention through better DevOps practices. Risks are low to medium depending on the fix.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because Python cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. Missing installation of the module (if third-party)  \n2. Incorrect Python path configuration (if local module)  \n3. Virtual environment misalignment (module installed in wrong environment)  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' is a local module or third-party package  \n2. If third-party: Run `pip install dexter_brain` (or specific version if required)  \n3. If local:  \n   a. Confirm module exists in project directory  \n   b. Add directory to PYTHONPATH: `export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/module:$PYTHONPATH`  \n   c. Alternatively, move module to same directory as main.py  \n4. Check virtual environment: Ensure correct environment is activated and module is installed there  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. For third-party modules: Add `dexter_brain` to requirements.txt  \n   ```bash\n   echo \"dexter_brain==<version>\" >> requirements.txt\n   ```  \n2. For local modules:  \n   a. Create proper package structure with __init__.py  \n   b. Install package in development mode:  \n   ```bash\n   pip install -e .\n   ```  \n   c. Or modify sys.path in main.py:  \n   ```python\n   import sys\n   sys.path.append('/path/to/dexter_brain')\n   ```  \n\nPrevention:  \n1. Implement dependency checking in CI/CD pipeline  \n2. Use virtual environment wrappers (e.g., pipenv, poetry) for environment management  \n3. Add pre-startup script to validate all required modules  \n4. Configure IDE to use project's virtual environment  \n\nRisk_Level: LOW  \nConfidence: HIGH  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
