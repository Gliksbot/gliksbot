  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The traceback shows it's happening in main.py line 120 when importing from dexter_brain.sandbox. So the immediate issue is a missing module.\n\nLooking at the error type, it's a STARTUP_ERROR, which suggests the system can't start because this module is required. The source is the system itself, so it's a core component missing. The context isn't available, which might mean there's no additional logging, but the stack trace gives enough info.\n\nFor the root cause analysis: The most common reasons for a ModuleNotFoundError are that the module isn't installed, not in the Python path, or there's a typo in the import. Since the error is happening during startup, it's likely that the dexter_brain package isn't installed in the environment where the application is running. Alternatively, the package might be installed but not in the correct directory, or there's an issue with the Python environment configuration.\n\nImmediate actions would involve checking if the module is installed. The user should run pip install dexter_brain or ensure it's included in the requirements. If it's a local module, maybe the path is incorrect. They should verify the installation and the Python path. Also, checking the environment (like virtualenv) to make sure it's activated.\n\nFor a permanent fix, ensuring that the module is properly installed and included in the deployment process. If it's a third-party package, adding it to requirements.txt. If it's an internal package, making sure it's part of the repository or package management. Also, setting up proper environment configurations so that the Python path includes the necessary directories.\n\nPrevention would involve adding checks during the build or deployment process to ensure all dependencies are installed. Implementing automated testing that includes startup tests to catch missing modules early. Monitoring for ModuleNotFoundError in logs and setting up alerts. Also, using virtual environments and dependency management tools to maintain consistency across environments.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing the missing module is low if it's a standard package. However, if dexter_brain is a custom module, there might be version compatibility issues. The confidence level here is high because the error is straightforward, but if the module isn't available, that could be a problem.\n\nWait, but the user might not have access to the dexter_brain module. If it's a third-party package, they need to install it. If it's internal, maybe the repository isn't included in the project. So the solution depends on where dexter_brain comes from. Since the error is in the backend code, perhaps it's a local module that's missing. The code is trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox, which might be part of the project structure but not properly included.\n\nSo, checking the project structure: is there a dexter_brain directory with an __init__.py file? If not, that's the issue. The immediate action would be to ensure that the module exists in the correct location. If it's supposed to be a package, maybe the setup.py is missing, or it's not installed in development mode.\n\nAlternatively, if the module is part of another repository or package, it needs to be installed. The user should check the requirements and the installation steps. If it's a private package, they might need to install it from a specific index or include it in the project.\n\nIn terms of implementation steps, the user should first check if the module exists in the environment. If not, install it. If it's a local module, adjust the Python path or move the module to the correct directory. For a permanent fix, ensure that the deployment process includes installing all dependencies, and that the project structure is correct.\n\nPrevention could involve adding a step in the CI/CD pipeline to check for missing modules, or using tools like pipenv or poetry to manage dependencies more strictly. Also, documenting the dependencies clearly so that anyone setting up the project knows what's needed.\n\nRisk level for the solution: If installing the module is straightforward, the risk is low. But if the module has dependencies that conflict with existing ones, that could cause issues. Confidence is high if the module is known and available, but if it's missing or not accessible, confidence might be lower.\n\nSo putting it all together, the analysis is that the module isn't installed or not in the Python path. Immediate action is to install the module or fix the path. Permanent fix is to ensure dependencies are managed properly. Prevention through better dependency management and testing. Risk is low to medium depending on the module's availability.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This typically occurs due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect directory structure or environment misconfiguration).  \n3. **Custom Module Missing**: If `dexter_brain` is a local/custom module, it may be absent from the project repository or not properly linked.  \n\n**Contextual Clues**:  \n- The error occurs in `main.py` during the `startup_event`, suggesting `dexter_brain` is a critical dependency for system initialization.  \n- No context is available, implying potential gaps in logging or environment setup.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Immediate Diagnosis**:  \n   - Verify if `dexter_brain` is installed in the current environment.  \n   - Check the project structure for the presence of the `dexter_brain` module.  \n   - Validate the Python path to ensure it includes the module’s location.  \n\n2. **Solution Prioritization**:  \n   - **Install Missing Module**: If `dexter_brain` is a third-party package, install it via `pip`.  \n   - **Fix Path/Environment**: If the module exists locally, adjust the Python path or reorganize the project structure.  \n   - **Dependency Management**: Ensure dependencies are explicitly defined in `requirements.txt` or similar files.  \n\n3. **Prevention**:  \n   - Automate dependency checks during deployment.  \n   - Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies.  \n   - Implement monitoring for missing modules during startup.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### **Immediate_Action**  \n1. **Check Installation**:  \n   ```bash  \n   # Check if dexter_brain is installed  \n   python -c \"import dexter_brain; print(dexter_brain.__file__)\"  \n   ```  \n   If this fails, proceed to install.  \n\n2. **Install the Module**:  \n   - If `dexter_brain` is a third-party package:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install dexter_brain  \n     ```  \n   - If it’s a local/custom module:  \n     - Ensure the module directory is in the project root or a recognized path.  \n     - Alternatively, install it in development mode:  \n       ```bash  \n       pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain  \n       ```  \n\n3. **Verify Python Path**:  \n   - Temporarily add the module’s path to `PYTHONPATH`:  \n     ```bash  \n     export PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/dexter_brain\"  \n     ```  \n   - Or modify `sys.path` in `main.py` (not recommended for production):  \n     ```python  \n     import sys  \n     sys.path.append(\"/path/to/dexter_brain\")  \n     ```  \n\n---\n\n#### **Permanent_Fix**  \n1. **Define Dependencies Explicitly**:  \n   - Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt`:  \n     ```txt  \n     dexter_brain==<version>  \n     ```  \n   - If it’s a private package, include installation instructions (e.g., from a Git repo):  \n     ```txt  \n     git+https://github.com/yourorg/dexter_brain.git@main  \n     ```  \n\n2. **Environment Configuration**:  \n   - Use `pipenv` or `poetry` to manage dependencies and environments.  \n   - Ensure deployment scripts install dependencies before starting the application.  \n\n3. **Project Structure**:  \n   - If `dexter_brain` is part of the monorepo, ensure it’s included in the repository and properly referenced.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Prevention**  \n1. **Automated Dependency Checks**:  \n   - Add a pre-startup script to validate dependencies:  \n     ```bash  \n     # Example: Check for dexter_brain before starting  \n     python -c \"import dexter_brain\" || { echo \"Missing dexter_brain\"; exit 1; }  \n     ```  \n\n2. **Monitoring and Alerts**:  \n   - Integrate logging for startup errors and set up alerts for `ModuleNotFoundError`.  \n   - Use tools like Prometheus or Sentry to track missing modules.  \n\n3. **CI/CD Pipeline**:  \n   - Include a test step in CI to verify all imports in critical files (e.g., `main.py`).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Risk Assessment**  \n- **Risk Level**: **LOW**  \n  - Installing a missing module is low-risk if the module is trusted and version-compatible.  \n  - Adjusting paths temporarily may introduce fragility but is mitigated by permanent fixes.  \n- **Confidence**: **HIGH**  \n  - The error is straightforward, and the solution aligns with standard Python dependency management practices.  \n\n---\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (If Required)  \nIf the team lacks expertise in Python dependency management:  \n```markdown  \n**Skill: Python Dependency Management**  \n**Description**: Ability to install, manage, and troubleshoot Python packages using pip, virtual environments, and dependency lockfiles.  \n**Training Steps**:  \n1. Learn to use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to capture dependencies.  \n2. Practice creating and activating virtual environments (`python -m venv env`).  \n3. Study `setup.py` and `pyproject.toml` for packaging custom modules.  \n```  \n\n--- \n\n**Collaboration Note**:  \nThis solution balances speed and stability. Immediate actions resolve the error quickly, while permanent fixes ensure long-term reliability. Team members should confirm the origin of `dexter_brain` (third-party vs. internal) to refine the implementation."
