  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The stack trace points to line 120 in main.py where it's trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox. So the immediate issue is that the module isn't available in the environment where the code is running.\n\nLooking at the context, there's no context available, which might mean that the error occurs during startup, so maybe the environment isn't set up correctly. The system status shows recent and critical errors, but the main one here is the startup error.\n\nFor the root cause analysis: The most likely reason is that the 'dexter_brain' package isn't installed in the Python environment. Alternatively, the Python path might not include the directory where dexter_brain is located. Another possibility is a typo in the module name, but the error message says 'dexter_brain' exactly, so maybe not. Also, if the module is supposed to be part of the project, maybe it's not properly structured or included in the installation.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if the module exists in the environment. The user should verify if 'dexter_brain' is installed. If not, install it using pip. If it's a local module, ensure that the Python path includes the directory where it's located. Alternatively, if the module is part of the project, maybe the setup.py or similar configuration is missing, so installing the project in development mode could help.\n\nFor a permanent fix, the solution would involve ensuring that the module is properly installed and available. If it's a third-party package, adding it to the requirements.txt and installing it. If it's a local module, making sure that the project structure is correct and that the module is included in the package. Also, checking the PYTHONPATH environment variable to include the necessary directories.\n\nPrevention could involve adding checks during the build or startup process to verify that all required modules are present. Implementing automated tests or a linter that checks for missing imports. Also, using virtual environments to ensure consistency across deployments. Monitoring for ModuleNotFoundError in logs and setting up alerts.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing package is low if it's a known and trusted package. However, if the package has dependencies that could conflict with existing ones, that might be a medium risk. For immediate actions like modifying the PYTHONPATH, there's a risk of introducing other issues if not done correctly, so that's medium. The permanent fix of adjusting the project structure or setup files is low risk if done properly.\n\nI need to structure the answer according to the required format. Let me make sure each section addresses the points. The root cause is the missing module. Immediate action is installing the package or adjusting the path. Permanent fix is ensuring the module is part of the environment. Prevention through checks and monitoring. Risk level for the solution is low to medium.\n\nWait, but what if 'dexter_brain' is a custom module that's part of the project? Then the issue might be that the project isn't installed correctly. So the user should check if the package is in the right location and if __init__.py files are present. Alternatively, using pip install -e . in the project directory for development.\n\nIn the immediate action, steps could include checking if the module exists, installing it, or adding the path. The permanent fix would be to include it in the setup.py or requirements. Prevention could involve CI/CD checks for missing dependencies.\n\nI think that's the right approach. Now, structure the answer accordingly.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because the Python interpreter cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is typically caused by one of three issues:  \n1. The module is not installed in the active Python environment  \n2. The module's directory is not in the Python path  \n3. The module is part of the project but improperly structured or not included in installation  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify module existence: Check if 'dexter_brain' exists in the project directory or as an installed package  \n2. Install missing package: Run `pip install dexter-brain` (if it's a third-party package)  \n3. Add path temporarily: If local module, modify code to add its directory to sys.path before import  \n   ```python  \n   import sys  \n   sys.path.append(\"M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\path_to_dexter_brain\")  \n   ```  \n4. Test import: Run `python -c \"import dexter_brain\"` to verify availability  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. If third-party: Add to requirements.txt and install in virtual environment  \n2. If local module:  \n   - Ensure proper package structure with `__init__.py`  \n   - Install project in development mode:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install -e .  \n     ```  \n   - Update setup.py to include package  \n3. Configure PYTHONPATH environment variable to include module directory  \n\nPrevention:  \n1. Implement dependency checks in CI/CD pipeline  \n2. Add pre-startup script to validate all required modules  \n3. Use virtual environments with pinned dependencies  \n4. Monitor for ModuleNotFoundError in logging system  \n\nRisk_Level: LOW (installing missing dependencies is standard practice)  \nConfidence: HIGH (solution addresses all common causes of missing module errors)  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
