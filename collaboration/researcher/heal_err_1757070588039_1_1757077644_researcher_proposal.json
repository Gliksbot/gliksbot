  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The traceback shows it's happening in main.py line 120 when importing from dexter_brain.sandbox. So the immediate issue is a missing module.\n\nRoot cause analysis: The module 'dexter_brain' isn't installed or not in the Python path. Maybe it's a custom module that wasn't included in the environment, or there's a typo in the name. Also, looking at the system status, there are 9 recent errors and 2 critical ones, which might indicate a larger issue, but the current error is specific to this module.\n\nImmediate action: Check if the module exists in the project directory. If it's a third-party package, install it. If it's a local module, ensure it's in the right location and the Python path includes it. Restart the service after making changes.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure the module is properly installed or linked. If it's part of the project, maybe add it to the setup.py or requirements.txt. For a local module, check the directory structure and sys.path. Also, set up a virtual environment if not already using one to manage dependencies better.\n\nPrevention: Implement dependency checks during deployment, maybe a script that verifies all required modules are present. Add monitoring to track missing module errors and alert on them. Also, version control the module and ensure it's included in the build process.\n\nRisk assessment: The immediate action of installing a package might introduce new dependencies or conflicts, so risk is medium. The permanent fix with virtual environments and dependency management is lower risk. Confidence is high because this is a common issue with straightforward solutions.\n\nNeed to make sure the steps are concrete. For example, check the file system for dexter_brain directory, install via pip if it's a package, or adjust sys.path in the code. Also, consider if the module is supposed to be there but was deleted or moved.\n\nIn the implementation, provide specific commands like 'pip install dexter-brain' if it's a package, or adding the path in Python. If it's a local module, maybe the project structure changed, so checking the import statements and directory layout is important.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that Python cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This typically occurs due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect directory structure or virtual environment misconfiguration).  \n3. **Typo/Mismatch**: A typo in the module name or version mismatch between development and deployment environments.  \n\nGiven the context (no prior context available), the most likely cause is a missing installation or path issue.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Immediate Action**:  \n   - Verify if `dexter_brain` is a third-party package or a local module.  \n   - If third-party: Install it via `pip`.  \n   - If local: Ensure the module’s directory is in the Python path.  \n   - Restart the service after changes.  \n\n2. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Add `dexter_brain` to the project’s dependency list (e.g., `requirements.txt`).  \n   - Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies and ensure consistency.  \n   - Validate the module’s location and import path in the codebase.  \n\n3. **Prevention**:  \n   - Implement automated dependency checks during deployment.  \n   - Add monitoring for missing modules and alert on startup failures.  \n   - Use tools like `pip-check` to verify installed packages.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### **Immediate_Action**  \n1. **Check Module Type**:  \n   - If `dexter_brain` is a third-party package:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install dexter-brain  # Note: Hyphen vs underscore may vary  \n     ```  \n   - If local:  \n     - Confirm the module exists in the project directory (e.g., `M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\dexter_brain`).  \n     - Add the directory to the Python path in `main.py` (temporary fix):  \n       ```python  \n       import sys  \n       sys.path.append(\"M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\backend\")  \n       ```  \n\n2. **Restart Service**:  \n   ```bash  \n   # Example for a systemd service  \n   systemctl restart gliksbot.service  \n   ```  \n\n---\n\n#### **Permanent_Fix**  \n1. **Dependency Management**:  \n   - Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt`:  \n     ```txt  \n     dexter-brain==x.x.x  # Specify version if applicable  \n     ```  \n   - Install dependencies in a virtual environment:  \n     ```bash  \n     python -m venv venv  \n     source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS  \n     venv\\Scripts\\activate      # Windows  \n     pip install -r requirements.txt  \n     ```  \n\n2. **Code Adjustments**:  \n   - Ensure the module is imported correctly (e.g., `from dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox`).  \n   - Validate directory structure:  \n     ```  \n     M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\  \n         main.py  \n         dexter_brain\\  \n             __init__.py  \n             sandbox.py  \n     ```  \n\n---\n\n#### **Prevention**  \n1. **Automated Checks**:  \n   - Add a pre-start script to validate dependencies:  \n     ```bash  \n     # Example: check_module.sh  \n     python -c \"import dexter_brain\" || { echo \"Missing module: dexter_brain\"; exit 1; }  \n     ```  \n\n2. **Monitoring**:  \n   - Use tools like Prometheus or Sentry to alert on `ModuleNotFoundError`.  \n   - Log startup errors to a centralized system (e.g., ELK Stack).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Risk Assessment**  \n- **Risk Level**: **MEDIUM**  \n  - Installing third-party packages may introduce compatibility issues.  \n  - Modifying `sys.path` can lead to path-related bugs in production.  \n- **Confidence**: **HIGH**  \n  - The solution addresses common causes of missing module errors.  \n\n---\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (If Required)  \nIf `dexter_brain` is a custom module not available externally:  \n```python  \n# SKILL: Module Path Validator  \ndef validate_module_path(module_name, expected_path):  \n    import sys  \n    if module_name not in sys.modules:  \n        if expected_path not in sys.path:  \n            sys.path.append(expected_path)  \n            print(f\"Added {expected_path} to Python path for {module_name}\")  \n    else:  \n        print(f\"{module_name} already loaded.\")  \n\n# Usage in main.py  \nvalidate_module_path(\"dexter_brain\", \"M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\backend\")  \n```  \n\nThis ensures the module path is dynamically validated on startup."
