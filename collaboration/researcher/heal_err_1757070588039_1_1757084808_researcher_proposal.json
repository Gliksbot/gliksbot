  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to parse through that first. The error is a STARTUP_ERROR with the message \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". The stack trace shows that the main.py file is trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox, but that module isn't found.\n\nFirst, the root cause. The most common reason for a \"ModuleNotFoundError\" is that the required package isn't installed in the Python environment. Alternatively, the module might be present but not in the Python path. Since the error occurs during startup, it's likely that the dexter_brain package isn't installed in the environment where the backend is running.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if the package is installed. If not, install it. But how? The user might need to run pip install, but maybe the package is a local module. If it's a local module, the directory structure might be incorrect, or the Python path isn't set properly. Alternatively, there could be a typo in the module name.\n\nFor a permanent fix, ensuring that the package is included in the project's dependencies and that the environment is correctly configured. If it's a third-party package, adding it to requirements.txt. If it's a local module, making sure it's in the right location and that the __init__.py files are present.\n\nPrevention would involve checking dependencies during deployment, maybe using virtual environments, and having tests that verify all imports work. Also, monitoring for missing modules during startup.\n\nRisk assessment: Installing a missing package is generally low risk, but if the package has dependencies that conflict with existing ones, there could be issues. If the module is supposed to be there but isn't due to a deployment error, fixing the deployment process would be better.\n\nNow, considering the system context. The error is in the backend's main.py, so the server might be trying to start without the necessary components. The user might be using a virtual environment where dexter_brain isn't installed. Or maybe the package is not properly structured.\n\nThe solution approach should first check if the package exists. If it's a third-party package, install it. If it's a local package, ensure it's in the Python path. For immediate action, installing the package via pip if possible. If not, adjusting the sys.path in the code to include the directory where dexter_brain is located.\n\nBut how to determine if it's a third-party or local package? The name 'dexter_brain' doesn't ring a bell as a common package, so it's likely a custom module. Therefore, the issue is probably that the module isn't in the right directory or the environment isn't set up correctly.\n\nSo, the immediate action would be to check the file system for the dexter_brain directory and ensure it's in the same directory as main.py or in a location included in the Python path. Alternatively, if it's a package that needs to be installed, maybe from a repository, then install it.\n\nFor the permanent fix, adding the necessary paths to the sys.path in the startup script, or restructuring the project so that dexter_brain is a subpackage. Also, ensuring that the deployment process includes all necessary modules.\n\nPrevention could involve adding checks in the startup script to verify that all required modules are present, and setting up CI/CD pipelines to test imports.\n\nRisk level: Low to medium. If the module is missing, installing or adding the path is straightforward. However, if there are version conflicts or other dependencies, that could complicate things.\n\nConfidence: High, because the error is straightforward, but depends on the actual setup.\n\nNow, considering the implementation steps. The user might need to run pip install if it's a package, but if it's a local module, they need to adjust the directory structure or Python path. Since the error is in the backend, maybe the dexter_brain module is part of the project but not included in the deployment.\n\nSo, the immediate action steps would be:\n\n1. Check if dexter_brain is a local module. Look in the project directory for a folder named dexter_brain with an __init__.py file.\n2. If it's a local module, ensure that the directory containing dexter_brain is in the Python path. This can be done by adding the parent directory to sys.path in main.py before the import.\n3. If it's a third-party package, install it using pip install dexter_brain (if available) or from a specific repository.\n\nPermanent fix would involve either installing the package (if third-party) or ensuring that the module is included in the project structure and that the deployment process includes it. Also, updating the requirements.txt or setup.py to include dependencies.\n\nPrevention steps could include adding a check in the startup script to verify that dexter_brain is importable, and setting up monitoring to alert if such errors occur. Also, using virtual environments and ensuring that all dependencies are properly listed.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of adding a path or installing a package is low if done correctly. However, if the module is not supposed to be there, it might indicate a larger issue in the deployment process.\n\nSo, putting this all together into the required format.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that Python cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect directory structure or missing `__init__.py`).  \n3. **Deployment Issue**: The module was not included in the deployment package.  \n\n**Context**:  \n- The error occurs in `main.py` during the `startup_event`, suggesting the system relies on `dexter_brain` for core functionality.  \n- No context is available, so assumptions about the module’s origin (local vs. third-party) are required.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Immediate Action**:  \n   - Verify if `dexter_brain` is a local module or third-party package.  \n   - If local, check its presence in the project directory and Python path.  \n   - If third-party, install it via `pip`.  \n\n2. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Ensure `dexter_brain` is included in the project’s dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt`).  \n   - Adjust the Python path dynamically if the module is in a non-standard location.  \n\n3. **Prevention**:  \n   - Add pre-startup checks to validate module availability.  \n   - Use virtual environments and CI/CD pipelines to enforce dependency consistency.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### **Immediate_Action**  \n1. **Check Module Type**:  \n   - Navigate to the project root and search for a directory named `dexter_brain` containing `__init__.py`.  \n   - If found, proceed to step 2. If not, proceed to step 3.  \n\n2. **Add to Python Path (Local Module)**:  \n   - Modify `main.py` to include the module’s directory in `sys.path`:  \n     ```python  \n     import sys  \n     import os  \n     sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..')))  \n     ```  \n   - Ensure `..` points to the parent directory of `dexter_brain`.  \n\n3. **Install Third-Party Package**:  \n   - Run:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install dexter_brain  \n     ```  \n   - If the package is private, use a specific index URL or install from a repository.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Permanent_Fix**  \n1. **For Local Modules**:  \n   - Restructure the project to include `dexter_brain` as a subpackage (e.g., move it into the `backend` directory).  \n   - Update `requirements.txt` to include local dependencies if applicable.  \n\n2. **For Third-Party Packages**:  \n   - Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt`:  \n     ```  \n     dexter_brain==x.y.z  # Replace with version  \n     ```  \n   - Ensure the environment uses `pip install -r requirements.txt` during deployment.  \n\n3. **Code-Level Fix**:  \n   - Add a pre-import check in `main.py`:  \n     ```python  \n     try:  \n         from dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox  \n     except ModuleNotFoundError:  \n         raise RuntimeError(\"Missing dependency: dexter_brain. Install it or adjust the Python path.\")  \n     ```  \n\n---\n\n#### **Prevention**  \n1. **Automated Checks**:  \n   - Add a startup script (`check_dependencies.py`) to validate critical imports:  \n     ```python  \n     try:  \n         import dexter_brain  \n     except ImportError:  \n         print(\"ERROR: dexter_brain missing\")  \n         exit(1)  \n     ```  \n   - Run this script before starting the backend.  \n\n2. **CI/CD Integration**:  \n   - Include a test in CI pipelines to ensure all dependencies are installable:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install -r requirements.txt  \n     python -c \"import dexter_brain\"  \n     ```  \n\n3. **Monitoring**:  \n   - Set up alerts for `ModuleNotFoundError` in logging systems (e.g., Sentry, Datadog).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Risk_Level**  \n**LOW**  \n- Adding paths or installing packages is low-risk if tested in staging.  \n- Risk of dependency conflicts exists but is mitigated by virtual environments.  \n\n#### **Confidence**  \n**HIGH**  \n- The solution addresses the most common causes of `ModuleNotFoundError`.  \n\n--- \n\n### SKILL_SPEC (Optional)  \nIf the team lacks Python debugging skills, define a skill:  \n```json  \n{  \n  \"skill\": \"Python Module Resolution\",  \n  \"description\": \"Diagnose and resolve Python import errors by analyzing module paths, dependencies, and project structure.\",  \n  \"tools\": [\"pip\", \"sys.path\", \"importlib.util\"]  \n}  \n```  \n\n---  \nThis approach balances rapid mitigation with long-term stability, ensuring minimal disruption to operations."
