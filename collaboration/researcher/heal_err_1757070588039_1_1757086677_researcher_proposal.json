  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to parse through that first. The error is a STARTUP_ERROR with the message \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". The stack trace points to main.py line 120 where it's trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nHmm, the root cause here seems straightforward. The Python interpreter can't find the 'dexter_brain' module. That usually happens when the module isn't installed, not in the Python path, or there's a typo in the import statement. Since the error is during startup, it's likely that the module isn't installed in the environment where the application is running.\n\nLooking at the system status, there are recent errors and critical ones. The related STARTUP_ERRORS are 2, so maybe this has happened before. The context isn't available, so I have to rely on the given info.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if the module exists in the environment. If it's a package that needs to be installed, then installing it via pip or the appropriate package manager would be the first step. Alternatively, if it's a local module, ensuring that the Python path includes the directory where dexter_brain is located.\n\nFor a permanent fix, the solution would involve making sure that the module is properly installed and available in the environment. If it's a third-party package, adding it to the requirements.txt or similar. If it's an internal module, ensuring the correct directory structure and that the path is set correctly in the code or environment variables.\n\nPrevention could involve adding checks during the build or deployment process to ensure all dependencies are installed. Maybe integrating a linter or a dependency checker that runs before deployment to catch missing modules. Also, monitoring for similar errors in the future.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing module is generally low, especially if it's a known package. However, if the module has dependencies that might conflict with existing ones, that could be a problem. So checking compatibility would be important.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that the system is in healing mode, so they might need a quick fix first. The immediate action should be actionable. Let me structure the response accordingly.\n\nIn the implementation, if the module is a package, the command would be pip install dexter_brain. If it's a local module, maybe adjusting the PYTHONPATH or adding the directory to sys.path in the code. But without more context, it's safer to assume it's a missing package. However, sometimes 'dexter_brain' could be a custom module, so the user might need to check their project structure.\n\nBut the error message says \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\", which suggests that the package isn't installed. So the immediate action would be to install it. But if it's not available on PyPI, then the user might need to install from a specific source or check the code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is expecting a module that's part of the project but not properly included in the deployment. So checking the deployment process to ensure all necessary files are included.\n\nIn any case, the steps would involve verifying the presence of the module, installing it if necessary, and ensuring the environment is correctly configured.\n\nFor the prevention part, adding automated checks in CI/CD pipelines to verify dependencies, using virtual environments to ensure consistency, and monitoring for missing modules during startup.\n\nRisk level: Low to medium. Installing a package could introduce conflicts, but if it's a required module, it's necessary. The confidence level would be high since the error is clear, but depends on whether the module exists and can be installed.\n\nSo putting it all together in the required format.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This typically occurs due to:  \n1. Missing installation of the `dexter_brain` package (if it’s a third-party library).  \n2. Incorrect Python path configuration (if `dexter_brain` is a local/custom module).  \n3. Deployment issues (e.g., missing files in the production environment).  \n\n**Contextual Clues**:  \n- The error occurs in `main.py` during the `startup_event`, suggesting the module is critical for initialization.  \n- No context is available, so assumptions must be based on standard Python module resolution behavior.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Immediate Action**:  \n   - Verify if `dexter_brain` is a third-party package or a local module.  \n   - Install the package (if applicable) or ensure the local module is in the Python path.  \n\n2. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Ensure dependencies are explicitly declared in `requirements.txt` or similar.  \n   - Validate deployment scripts to include all required modules.  \n\n3. **Prevention**:  \n   - Implement dependency checks during CI/CD pipelines.  \n   - Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies.  \n\n4. **Risk Assessment**:  \n   - Low risk if installing a known package.  \n   - Medium risk if modifying Python paths or deployment configurations.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### 1. **Immediate Action**  \n**Steps**:  \n```bash  \n# Check if dexter_brain is a third-party package  \npip install dexter_brain  \n\n# If the above fails, verify local module structure  \n# Ensure the directory containing 'dexter_brain' is in PYTHONPATH  \nexport PYTHONPATH=/path/to/parent_directory_of_dexter_brain:$PYTHONPATH  \n\n# Alternatively, modify the code to add the path dynamically (temporary fix)  \n# Add to main.py before the import:  \n# import sys  \n# sys.path.append(\"/path/to/parent_directory_of_dexter_brain\")  \n```  \n\n#### 2. **Permanent Fix**  \n**Implementation Details**:  \n- **If third-party package**:  \n  Add to `requirements.txt`:  \n  ```  \n  dexter_brain==<version>  \n  ```  \n  Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the deployment environment.  \n\n- **If local module**:  \n  Ensure the project structure includes `dexter_brain` in the root directory (same level as `main.py`).  \n  Example structure:  \n  ```  \n  /project_root  \n    ├── main.py  \n    └── dexter_brain/  \n        ├── __init__.py  \n        └── sandbox.py  \n  ```  \n  Ensure `__init__.py` exists to mark the directory as a Python package.  \n\n#### 3. **Prevention**  \n- **Automated Dependency Check**:  \n  Add a pre-startup script to validate dependencies:  \n  ```bash  \n  # check_dependencies.sh  \n  python -c \"import dexter_brain\" || { echo \"Missing module: dexter_brain\"; exit 1; }  \n  ```  \n- **CI/CD Integration**:  \n  Use tools like `pylint` or `flake8` to detect missing imports during code reviews.  \n\n#### 4. **Risk Level**: **LOW**  \n- Installing a missing package or adjusting paths poses minimal risk if tested in a staging environment first.  \n\n#### 5. **Confidence**: **HIGH**  \n- The error is a standard Python module resolution issue, and the proposed solutions address common root causes.  \n\n--- \n\n### SKILL_SPEC (If Required)  \n**Skill**: Python Module Resolution and Dependency Management  \n**Code**:  \n```python  \n# Example of dynamic path addition (use as last resort)  \nimport sys  \nimport os  \n\n# Add the parent directory of dexter_brain to sys.path  \ndexter_brain_path = os.path.abspath(\"../path/to/dexter_brain\")  \nif dexter_brain_path not in sys.path:  \n    sys.path.append(dexter_brain_path)  \n\n# Now import the module  \nfrom dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox  \n```  \n\n**Note**: Use this only if the module is local and path adjustments are unavoidable. Prefer explicit dependency management."
