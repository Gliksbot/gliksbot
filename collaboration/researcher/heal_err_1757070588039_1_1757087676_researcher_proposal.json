  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to parse through that. The error is a STARTUP_ERROR with the message \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". The stack trace shows it's happening in main.py when trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nFirst, root cause analysis. The error is a ModuleNotFoundError, which typically means that the Python environment doesn't have the required module installed. But since the module is named 'dexter_brain', which isn't a standard Python package, it's probably a custom module specific to this project. So the issue could be that the module isn't installed in the current environment, or the Python path isn't set up correctly to find it.\n\nLooking at the system status, there are recent errors and critical ones, but this is a startup error. The context isn't available, so maybe the environment variables or the project structure has changed. Maybe the dexter_brain package isn't in the right directory, or the virtual environment isn't activated.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if the module exists in the project directory. If it's a local package, the user might need to install it in development mode or ensure that the current directory is in the Python path. Alternatively, if it's a third-party package, they might need to install it via pip, but the name suggests it's custom.\n\nFor a permanent fix, the solution would involve ensuring that the module is properly installed and accessible. If it's part of the project, using a setup.py or pyproject.toml to package it and install it as an editable package (pip install -e .) would be the way to go. Also, checking the PYTHONPATH environment variable to make sure it includes the directory where dexter_brain is located.\n\nPrevention would involve setting up proper testing environments, using virtual environments, and ensuring that dependencies are clearly defined. Maybe implementing a check in the startup script to verify that all required modules are present before proceeding.\n\nRisk assessment: The immediate action might involve modifying environment variables or installing packages, which could have risks if done in a production environment. But since it's a startup error, the system isn't running, so the risk might be lower. The permanent fix involves packaging and installation, which is standard practice, so risk is low.\n\nNow, considering the user's request for a solution approach. They want the analysis, approach, and implementation. The user might need specific steps like checking the file structure, installing the package, modifying PYTHONPATH, etc.\n\nWait, but the error is in the backend main.py. So the project structure might have a dexter_brain directory that's not being recognized. The user should check if the dexter_brain package exists in the same directory as main.py or in a subdirectory, and whether there's an __init__.py file to make it a package.\n\nIf the package is missing, they need to restore it from version control or backups. If it's present but not in the path, adjusting the path in the code or environment would help. Alternatively, installing the package if it's a separate component.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Check if dexter_brain exists in the project directory.\n2. If it's a local package, ensure it's installed in the environment.\n3. If not, install it via pip or add it to the path.\n4. For permanent fix, set up proper packaging and dependencies.\n5. Add checks to prevent missing modules in the future.\n\nI need to structure this into the required sections: Analysis, Approach, Implementation. Also, check if any new skills are needed. The user mentioned if a new skill is required, provide a SKILL_SPEC and code. But in this case, it's standard Python troubleshooting, so maybe no new skill needed. But perhaps a code snippet to check the module or add to sys.path.\n\nWait, the user is an LLM working with a team of LLMs. So the initial proposal should be from the LLM's perspective. The response should be in the specified format with Analysis, Approach, Implementation. Also, the user wants the response to be concise but thorough.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAnalysis: The error is due to the absence of the 'dexter_brain' module in the Python environment. Possible causes include missing installation, incorrect project structure, or environment misconfiguration.\n\nApproach: Verify the presence of the module, install or link it, adjust environment variables, and implement dependency management.\n\nImplementation: Steps like checking directory structure, installing the package, modifying PYTHONPATH, and setting up proper packaging.\n\nAlso, considering the special considerations: prioritize solutions that don't disrupt operations. Since the system is in healing mode, immediate actions should be safe.\n\nPotential risks: Changing environment variables might affect other parts of the system, but if done correctly, it's low risk.\n\nConfidence level: High, because this is a common Python error with straightforward solutions.\n\nSo the final answer should follow the sections as per the user's request.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path Configuration**: The module exists but is not in a directory included in the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.  \n3. **Project Structure Issue**: The module might be part of the project but misplaced (e.g., not in the root directory or missing `__init__.py` files).  \n\n**Context**:  \n- The error occurs during startup, suggesting a dependency missing at runtime.  \n- No context is available, implying potential gaps in deployment or environment setup.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n**Immediate Action**:  \n1. **Verify Module Existence**: Check if the `dexter_brain` directory exists in the project root or a subdirectory.  \n2. **Install Dependencies**: If `dexter_brain` is a local package, install it in development mode (`pip install -e .`).  \n3. **Check Environment**: Ensure the correct Python environment is activated (e.g., virtualenv).  \n4. **Adjust PYTHONPATH**: Temporarily add the project root to `PYTHONPATH` to resolve path issues.  \n\n**Permanent Fix**:  \n1. **Package Configuration**: Use `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` to define `dexter_brain` as an installable package.  \n2. **Dependency Management**: Pin required packages in `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile` for consistent environments.  \n3. **Path Standardization**: Ensure the project root is included in the module search path via code or environment variables.  \n\n**Prevention**:  \n1. **Automated Checks**: Add a pre-startup script to validate module availability.  \n2. **CI/CD Integration**: Include dependency checks in CI pipelines to catch missing modules early.  \n3. **Environment Documentation**: Document setup steps for reproducibility.  \n\n**Risk Assessment**:  \n- **Immediate Action**: Low risk (temporary fixes like `PYTHONPATH` adjustments are reversible).  \n- **Permanent Fix**: Low risk (standard packaging practices improve maintainability).  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n**Immediate_Action**:  \n```bash\n# 1. Check if dexter_brain exists\nls -la /path/to/project/dexter_brain  # Verify directory and __init__.py\n\n# 2. Install in development mode (if local package)\ncd /path/to/project\npip install -e .\n\n# 3. Set PYTHONPATH temporarily\nexport PYTHONPATH=/path/to/project:$PYTHONPATH\npython main.py\n```\n\n**Permanent_Fix**:  \n1. **Create `setup.py`** (if missing):  \n```python\n# setup.py\nfrom setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\nsetup(\n    name=\"dexter_brain\",\n    version=\"0.1\",\n    packages=find_packages(),\n    install_requires=[]  # Add dependencies here\n)\n```\n2. **Install with pip**:  \n```bash\npip install .\n```\n\n**Prevention**:  \n- **Pre-startup Check Script** (`pre_start.sh`):  \n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nif ! python -c \"import dexter_brain\"; then\n    echo \"Error: dexter_brain module not found. Install dependencies.\"\n    exit 1\nfi\nexec \"$@\"\n```\n- **Add to CI Pipeline**:  \n```yaml\n# .github/workflows/ci.yml\njobs:\n  test:\n    steps:\n      - name: Check dependencies\n        run: python -c \"import dexter_brain\"\n```\n\n**Risk_Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH  \n\n---\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (Optional)  \nIf the team lacks Python packaging expertise:  \n```json\n{\n  \"skill\": \"Python Package Management\",\n  \"description\": \"Ability to configure and install Python packages using setuptools and pip.\",\n  \"resources\": [\n    \"https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/\",\n    \"https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages\"\n  ]\n}\n```  \n\nThis approach balances rapid resolution with long-term stability, ensuring minimal disruption to operations."
