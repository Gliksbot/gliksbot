  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through it step by step. The error is a NameError: 'auth_manager' is not defined. That usually means the variable auth_manager isn't declared in the current scope.\n\nLooking at the stack trace, the error occurs in the login function of main.py line 337. The line is user_info = auth_manager.authenticate_user(...). So, the code is trying to use auth_manager, but it's not defined anywhere in that scope.\n\nPossible causes: Maybe auth_manager was supposed to be imported but wasn't, or it's defined in a different module and not properly referenced. Alternatively, there could be a typo in the variable name. Let me check the context provided. The endpoint is /auth/login, so the authentication logic is involved here.\n\nThe system status shows there are 6 related NameErrors, which suggests this might be a recurring issue. The immediate action should be to check if auth_manager is correctly imported and initialized in the relevant code. The permanent fix would involve ensuring that the auth_manager is properly set up, maybe by importing it from the correct module or initializing it correctly in the application.\n\nFor prevention, adding checks during code reviews or automated tests to ensure that all dependencies are correctly imported. Also, setting up monitoring to catch NameErrors early. The risk of the solution would depend on how the auth_manager is implemented. If it's a simple import fix, the risk is low. If there's a deeper issue in the authentication setup, it might be higher.\n\nI need to structure the answer into Analysis, Immediate Action, Permanent Fix, Prevention, and Risk Assessment. Also, check if any new skills or code are needed. Since this seems like a straightforward import issue, maybe no new skills are required, but if the auth_manager is part of a larger system, there might be more to it. But based on the info given, the main issue is the undefined variable.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \nThe error `NameError: name 'auth_manager' is not defined` indicates that the variable `auth_manager` is referenced in the `login` function (line 337 of `main.py`) but is not declared or imported in the current scope. This typically occurs due to:  \n1. Missing import statement for `auth_manager`.  \n2. Incorrect initialization of the `auth_manager` object (e.g., not instantiated).  \n3. A typo or case sensitivity issue in the variable name.  \n\nThe error originates in the API layer (`source: api`) during an authentication request, suggesting a flaw in the application's dependency injection or module structure. The presence of 6 related `NameError` errors implies systemic issues in code organization or testing.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Root Cause**:  \n   - `auth_manager` is not imported or initialized before use in `main.py`.  \n   - Likely caused by a missing `from ... import auth_manager` statement or failure to instantiate it (e.g., `auth_manager = AuthManager()`).  \n\n2. **Immediate Action**:  \n   - Temporarily pause the service if the error is critical.  \n   - Check recent code changes for missing imports or incorrect variable references.  \n\n3. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Ensure `auth_manager` is properly imported and initialized in `main.py`.  \n   - Refactor code to centralize dependency management (e.g., using a dependency injection framework).  \n\n4. **Prevention**:  \n   - Add automated tests to validate imports and object initialization.  \n   - Implement static code analysis tools (e.g., `pylint`, `flake8`) to catch undefined variables.  \n\n5. **Risk Assessment**:  \n   - **Risk Level**: LOW (fixing an undefined variable is straightforward).  \n   - **Confidence**: HIGH (error is clear and common in Python applications).  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### 1. **Immediate Action**  \n**Steps**:  \n- **Check Code**:  \n  Open `main.py` and verify if `auth_manager` is imported or initialized. Example fix:  \n  ```python  \n  # At the top of main.py  \n  from your_module import auth_manager  # Replace with correct module path  \n  ```  \n  Or initialize it explicitly:  \n  ```python  \n  auth_manager = AuthManager()  # If AuthManager is a class  \n  ```  \n\n- **Restart Service**:  \n  After fixing, restart the API service to apply changes.  \n\n#### 2. **Permanent Fix**  \n**Code Changes**:  \n- **Option 1**: Add missing import.  \n  ```python  \n  # main.py  \n  from auth import auth_manager  # Example import path  \n  ```  \n- **Option 2**: Initialize the manager in the function.  \n  ```python  \n  async def login(request: Request, credentials: Credentials):  \n      auth_manager = AuthManager()  # Initialize here if not done globally  \n      user_info = auth_manager.authenticate_user(...)  \n  ```  \n\n- **Refactor for Dependency Injection**:  \n  Use FastAPIâ€™s dependency injection to manage `auth_manager` centrally:  \n  ```python  \n  # In a shared module (e.g., dependencies.py)  \n  def get_auth_manager():  \n      return AuthManager()  \n\n  # In main.py  \n  from fastapi import Depends  \n  async def login(  \n      request: Request,  \n      credentials: Credentials,  \n      auth_manager: AuthManager = Depends(get_auth_manager)  \n  ):  \n      user_info = auth_manager.authenticate_user(...)  \n  ```  \n\n#### 3. **Prevention**  \n- **Add Tests**:  \n  Write unit tests to ensure `auth_manager` is always available:  \n  ```python  \n  # test_auth.py  \n  def test_auth_manager_initialized():  \n      from main import app  \n      # Mock request and check if auth_manager exists  \n  ```  \n- **Static Analysis**:  \n  Integrate `pylint` or `mypy` into CI/CD to flag undefined variables.  \n\n#### 4. **Risk Mitigation**  \n- **Low Risk**: Fixing undefined variables is non-invasive and unlikely to break other components.  \n- **Rollback Plan**: If issues arise, revert the import/initialization change and re-investigate.  \n\n---\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (Optional)  \nIf the team lacks Python debugging expertise:  \n```json  \n{  \n  \"skill\": \"Python Debugging & Dependency Management\",  \n  \"description\": \"Ability to trace variable scope, import modules correctly, and use FastAPI dependency injection.\",  \n  \"resources\": [  \n    \"https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html\",  \n    \"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/dependency-injection/\"  \n  ]  \n}  \n```  \n\n---  \n**Vote**: This solution balances speed (immediate fix) and robustness (permanent refactoring) with minimal risk."
