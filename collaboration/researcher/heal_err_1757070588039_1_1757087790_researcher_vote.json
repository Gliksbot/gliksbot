  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a STARTUP_ERROR because the module 'dexter_brain' isn't found. First, I need to figure out why that module is missing.\n\nRoot Cause: The error message says \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\", which usually means the module isn't installed in the Python environment. Since it's a startup error, the system is trying to import this module during initialization but can't find it. Possible reasons could be that the module isn't installed, the Python path isn't set correctly, or there's a typo in the import statement. But looking at the context, the source is 'system', so maybe the module is part of the project and wasn't properly included in the environment.\n\nImmediate Action: The user needs to check if the module exists in the project directory. If it's a local module, maybe it's not in the right location. They should verify the file structure. If it's a third-party package, they need to install it using pip. Also, checking the Python path to ensure the directory containing 'dexter_brain' is included. Restarting the service after making changes might help.\n\nPermanent Fix: If the module is part of the project, ensuring it's included in the source control and deployed correctly. If it's a package, adding it to the requirements.txt so it's installed automatically. Also, checking the import statements for any typos. Maybe setting up a virtual environment to manage dependencies properly.\n\nPrevention: Implementing dependency management with tools like pipenv or poetry. Adding automated tests to check for missing modules during CI/CD pipelines. Monitoring the system for missing modules and setting up alerts. Also, documenting the dependencies clearly for future reference.\n\nRisk Assessment: The risk of installing a missing module could be medium if it's a third-party package with potential compatibility issues. But if it's a local module, the risk is lower. The immediate action of installing might not disrupt operations if done correctly, but there's a chance of version conflicts.\n\nSo putting it all together, the root cause is the missing module. Immediate steps are to install or locate the module. Permanent fix involves dependency management. Prevention through monitoring and testing. Risks are medium.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because Python cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. The module is not installed in the Python environment  \n2. The module's directory is not in the Python path  \n3. There's a typo/mismatch in the module name  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' is a local module (check project directory structure)  \n2. If local: Ensure the module file exists and is named correctly (e.g., `dexter_brain.py`)  \n3. If third-party: Install using `pip install dexter_brain` (if available on PyPI)  \n4. Add directory containing 'dexter_brain' to PYTHONPATH temporarily:  \n   `export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/module:$PYTHONPATH`  \n5. Restart service: `systemctl restart gliksbot` (or equivalent for your environment)  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. For local modules:  \n   - Ensure module directory is included in source control  \n   - Add to `setup.py` as part of package distribution  \n   - Use proper Python package structure (create `__init__.py` in module directory)  \n2. For third-party modules:  \n   - Add to `requirements.txt`  \n   - Implement dependency management with `pipenv` or `poetry`  \n3. Modify code to use relative imports if within the same package  \n\nPrevention:  \n1. Implement pre-deployment checks to verify all required modules exist  \n2. Add automated tests that import critical modules during CI/CD  \n3. Set up monitoring for `ModuleNotFoundError` exceptions  \n4. Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies  \n5. Document all dependencies in README and requirements files  \n\nRisk_Level: MEDIUM  \n- Risk of version conflicts when installing new packages  \n- Potential disruption if PYTHONPATH modification affects other services  \n\nConfidence: HIGH  \n- Solution addresses all common causes of missing module errors  \n- Steps are standard Python troubleshooting practices  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
