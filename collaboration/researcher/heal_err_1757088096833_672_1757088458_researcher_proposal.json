  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to parse through that to understand what's going on.\n\nFirst, the error is a HEALING_FAILED with the message \"maximum recursion depth exceeded.\" The stack trace shows a lot of repeated calls between log_error and _detect_patterns in the error_tracker.py file. It looks like there's an infinite recursion happening here. Every time log_error is called, it triggers _detect_patterns, which in turn calls log_error again, creating a loop that eventually exceeds Python's recursion limit.\n\nSo the root cause is probably a circular dependency between these two methods. When an error is logged, it tries to detect patterns, which logs another error, and so on. This would cause the recursion depth to blow up, especially if there's no base case to stop the recursion.\n\nLooking at the context, the original error ID is err_1757087886748_179, and the healing session is trying to handle that but getting stuck in this loop. The system status shows 21 related HEALING_FAILED errors, so this might be a recurring issue when the error healer encounters certain conditions.\n\nFor immediate action, we need to stop the recursion. Maybe adding a check to prevent log_error from being called recursively. Like a flag that indicates we're already in the process of logging an error, so we don't go into detect_patterns again. That would break the cycle.\n\nA permanent fix would involve refactoring the error detection logic to avoid the circular calls. Perhaps moving the pattern detection outside of the error logging process, or ensuring that detect_patterns doesn't trigger log_error for the same error type. Also, increasing the recursion limit might be a temporary band-aid, but it's not a real solution since the recursion is infinite.\n\nPrevention would involve adding monitoring for recursion depth, maybe setting up alerts when the call stack gets too deep. Code reviews to check for recursive method calls without termination conditions. Also, unit tests that simulate error logging to catch such issues before deployment.\n\nRisk assessment: The immediate action of adding a recursion flag is low risk because it's a simple check. The permanent fix might require more extensive changes, so there's a medium risk of introducing new bugs, but necessary to prevent future issues.\n\nNow, considering the code structure. The error_tracker.py has log_error which calls _detect_patterns, which in turn calls log_error again. So in the _detect_patterns method, when it encounters a condition, it logs an error, which restarts the process. To break this, maybe when log_error is called from within _detect_patterns, it should not trigger pattern detection again. So adding a parameter like 'from_detection' to log_error that skips the detection step if set.\n\nImplementation steps: Modify log_error to accept a parameter indicating whether it's being called from pattern detection. If so, skip calling _detect_patterns. Then, in _detect_patterns, when calling log_error, pass this parameter. Also, ensure that the original error logging from other sources still triggers detection unless it's part of the healing process.\n\nTesting this would involve simulating the error conditions that caused the recursion and ensuring that the flag prevents the loop. Also, checking that normal error logging still works as expected.\n\nSo the SKILL_SPEC would involve modifying the error_tracker's methods to include this flag and adjust the calls accordingly. The code changes would be in error_tracker.py, adding the 'from_detection' parameter and conditional logic.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `maximum recursion depth exceeded` stems from an infinite recursion loop between `log_error()` and `_detect_patterns()` in `error_tracker.py`. When an error is logged, `_detect_patterns()` is called, which recursively triggers `log_error()` again without a termination condition. This creates a stack overflow, especially during healing sessions where error patterns are aggressively detected.  \n\n**Key Observations**:  \n- The stack trace shows alternating calls between `log_error()` (line 97) and `_detect_patterns()` (line 209).  \n- The original error (`err_1757087886748_179`) likely triggered a healing session that entered this recursive loop.  \n- The system has 21 related `HEALING_FAILED` errors, indicating this is a recurring issue under specific conditions.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n**Immediate Action**:  \n1. **Break the Recursion**: Introduce a flag (e.g., `is_healing`) to prevent `log_error()` from re-triggering `_detect_patterns()` during active healing sessions.  \n2. **Increase Recursion Limit (Temporary)**: Temporarily raise Pythonâ€™s recursion limit to mitigate immediate failures while the fix is deployed.  \n\n**Permanent Fix**:  \n1. **Decouple Error Logging and Pattern Detection**: Restructure the code to ensure `log_error()` does not invoke `_detect_patterns()` when called from within pattern detection.  \n2. **Add Contextual Checks**: Only trigger pattern detection for errors that require it (e.g., non-healing-related errors).  \n\n**Prevention**:  \n1. **Monitoring**: Implement alerts for high recursion depth or repeated `HEALING_FAILED` errors.  \n2. **Code Review**: Audit all recursive calls in the error handling module for termination conditions.  \n3. **Unit Tests**: Add tests to simulate recursive error logging and validate termination.  \n\n**Risk Assessment**:  \n- **Immediate Action**: Low risk (simple flag addition).  \n- **Permanent Fix**: Medium risk (code restructuring may introduce edge cases).  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### SKILL_SPEC: Error Tracker Recursion Fix  \n```python\n# File: M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\dexter_brain\\error_tracker.py\n\ndef log_error(self, error, from_detection=False):\n    if from_detection and hasattr(error, 'context') and error.context.get('is_healing'):\n        # Skip pattern detection during active healing to break recursion\n        return\n    try:\n        self._detect_patterns(error)\n    except RecursionError:\n        # Log and handle recursion safely\n        print(\"Recursion detected. Skipping pattern detection.\")\n        pass\n\ndef _detect_patterns(self, error):\n    # Ensure errors logged during detection are marked to avoid recursion\n    error.context = error.context or {}\n    error.context['is_healing'] = True\n    self.log_error(error, from_detection=True)\n```\n\n#### Steps:  \n1. **Deploy the Updated `error_tracker.py`**:  \n   - Add the `from_detection` flag to `log_error()` to skip `_detect_patterns()` during healing.  \n   - Modify `_detect_patterns()` to mark errors with `is_healing=True` before logging.  \n\n2. **Temporary Recursion Limit Increase**:  \n   ```python\n   import sys\n   sys.setrecursionlimit(sys.getrecursionlimit() + 1000)  # Apply cautiously\n   ```  \n\n3. **Monitor and Test**:  \n   - Deploy to a staging environment and simulate the original error.  \n   - Validate that recursion no longer occurs and errors are logged correctly.  \n\n---\n\n### Confidence & Risk  \n- **Confidence**: HIGH (directly addresses the recursion loop).  \n- **Risk Level**: LOW (minimal code changes with clear termination logic).  \n\nThis solution balances immediate stability with long-term prevention while minimizing disruption to ongoing operations."
