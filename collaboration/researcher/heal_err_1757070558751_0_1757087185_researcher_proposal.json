  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to parse through that. The error is a STARTUP_ERROR with the message \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". The stack trace shows that the main.py file is trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox, but that module isn't found.\n\nFirst, root cause analysis. The most common reason for a ModuleNotFoundError is that the required package isn't installed in the Python environment. Alternatively, the module might be present but not in the Python path, or there could be a typo in the import statement. Since the error occurs during startup, it's likely that the dexter_brain package isn't installed or not properly configured.\n\nLooking at the context, there's no context available, so I can't see if the environment is set up correctly. The system status shows recent and critical errors, but not sure if they're related. The mission is to find the root cause and solutions.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if the package is installed. If not, install it. But how? The user might need to run a pip install command. However, the package name might not be exactly 'dexter_brain'—maybe it's a custom package or a private repository. Alternatively, if it's a local module, the directory structure might be incorrect, so checking the file system for the presence of the dexter_brain directory in the right location is important.\n\nFor a permanent fix, ensuring that the package is included in the project's dependencies, perhaps in a requirements.txt file, so that it's installed consistently across environments. If it's a local module, making sure that the Python path includes the directory where dexter_brain is located. Maybe the project structure changed, or the virtual environment isn't activated.\n\nPrevention would involve setting up monitoring to check for missing dependencies during deployment, using linters or tools like pyflakes to catch import errors before deployment. Also, ensuring that the CI/CD pipeline includes steps to validate all imports.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a new package could be medium if it's a third-party package with potential security issues. If it's a local module, the risk is lower. Changing the Python path might have unintended consequences if not done carefully.\n\nSo, the analysis would be that the dexter_brain module is missing. Immediate action is to install the package or adjust the path. Permanent fix is to ensure dependencies are properly managed. Prevention through better dependency management and testing. Risk level medium if installing a new package, low if adjusting paths.\n\nNow, structuring the response as per the user's format. Need to make sure each section is addressed clearly. Also, check if any new skills are needed. Since this is a Python module issue, no new skills are required beyond standard Python troubleshooting. So the SKILL_SPEC might not be necessary unless the user needs a specific tool, but in this case, probably not.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**: The error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This typically occurs due to one of the following:  \n1. The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. The module is installed but not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect directory structure or virtual environment misconfiguration).  \n3. A typo or case sensitivity issue in the import statement (though the error message suggests the name is correct).  \n\nGiven the error occurs during startup and the context is missing, the most likely cause is a missing dependency or environment misconfiguration.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Immediate Action**:  \n   - Verify if `dexter_brain` is installed in the active Python environment.  \n   - If missing, install it via `pip` or restore it from a backup/requirements file.  \n   - Check the Python path to ensure the module’s directory is included.  \n\n2. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Ensure `dexter_brain` is listed in the project’s `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` for consistent environment setup.  \n   - If `dexter_brain` is a local/custom module, confirm its directory is in the project root or add it to the Python path programmatically.  \n\n3. **Prevention**:  \n   - Implement dependency validation in CI/CD pipelines (e.g., `pip check` or `import-linter`).  \n   - Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies and avoid global Python modifications.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### Immediate_Action  \n1. **Check Installation**:  \n   Run in the terminal (ensure the correct virtual environment is active):  \n   ```bash  \n   pip show dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If not found, proceed to install.  \n\n2. **Install the Module**:  \n   If `dexter_brain` is a public package:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If it’s a local/custom module:  \n   - Ensure the directory containing `dexter_brain/__init__.py` is in the project root.  \n   - Alternatively, symlink the directory or modify `sys.path` in `main.py` (temporary fix):  \n     ```python  \n     import sys  \n     sys.path.append(\"M:/path/to/dexter_brain\")  \n     ```  \n\n3. **Verify Python Path**:  \n   Add debug code to `main.py` to print the Python path:  \n   ```python  \n   import sys  \n   print(sys.path)  \n   ```  \n   Confirm the module’s directory is listed.  \n\n#### Permanent_Fix  \n1. **Update Dependency Files**:  \n   If `dexter_brain` is a third-party package:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip freeze > requirements.txt  \n   ```  \n   If it’s a local module, ensure the project structure is standardized (e.g., `src/dexter_brain/`).  \n\n2. **Environment Configuration**:  \n   Use a virtual environment and activate it before running the application:  \n   ```bash  \n   python -m venv venv  \n   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS  \n   venv\\Scripts\\activate     # Windows  \n   pip install -r requirements.txt  \n   ```  \n\n#### Prevention  \n1. **CI/CD Validation**:  \n   Add a step in the CI pipeline to validate imports:  \n   ```bash  \n   # Example using import-linter  \n   pip install import-linter  \n   pylint --extension-pkg-whitelist=dexter_brain .  \n   ```  \n\n2. **Monitoring**:  \n   Set up alerts for startup failures using tools like Prometheus or Sentry.  \n\n---\n\n### Risk_Level  \n**MEDIUM**  \n- Installing third-party packages may introduce security risks or version conflicts.  \n- Modifying `sys.path` can lead to fragile environment setups.  \n\n### Confidence  \n**HIGH**  \nThe solution addresses the core issue of missing dependencies and environment configuration, which aligns with standard Python troubleshooting practices.  \n\n--- \n\n### SKILL_SPEC (If Required)  \nIf the team lacks Python environment management skills, provide training on:  \n- Virtual environments (`venv`)  \n- Dependency management (`pip`, `requirements.txt`)  \n- Python path configuration  \n\nNo new code required beyond standard Python tools."
