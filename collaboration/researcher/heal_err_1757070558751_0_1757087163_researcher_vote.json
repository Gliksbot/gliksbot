  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That's a Python import error. The system is trying to import a module called dexter_brain but it's not found. The stack trace points to line 120 in main.py where it's trying to import create_sandbox from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nRoot cause analysis: The most common reason for this error is that the module isn't installed in the current Python environment. Alternatively, the module might be present but not in the Python path, or there could be a typo in the module name. Since the error occurs during startup, it's likely that the module is missing from the environment where the application is running.\n\nImmediate action: The user needs to check if the dexter_brain module is installed. If not, install it using pip. If it's a local module, ensure it's in the right directory and the path is set correctly. Maybe the virtual environment isn't activated, so checking that is important.\n\nPermanent fix: The long-term solution would involve ensuring that all dependencies are properly listed in a requirements.txt file so that the environment can be recreated consistently. If dexter_brain is a third-party package, adding it to the requirements. If it's an internal package, making sure it's included in the project structure and the setup.py file if it's a package.\n\nPrevention: Setting up automated checks for missing dependencies during deployment, using CI/CD pipelines to test the environment setup, and monitoring for import errors in logs. Also, using virtual environments and Docker containers to isolate dependencies.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing module is low if it's a known package. However, if the module has dependencies that conflict with existing ones, there could be issues. So checking compatibility is important. The confidence level here is high because this is a standard Python error with straightforward solutions.\n\nNow, putting this all together into the required format. Need to make sure each section is addressed clearly and concisely. Also, considering the special considerations like not disrupting operations, so suggesting steps that can be done without downtime, like checking the environment first before installing.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because the Python module 'dexter_brain' is missing from the environment. This module is required during system startup for sandbox initialization. Likely causes include:  \n1. Missing installation of the module  \n2. Incorrect Python path configuration  \n3. Virtual environment misconfiguration  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' is a local module or third-party package  \n2. If third-party: Run `pip install dexter_brain` in the active environment  \n3. If local: Ensure the module directory is in the project root and add to PYTHONPATH:  \n   `export PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/gliksbot/backend\"`  \n4. Check virtual environment activation: `which python` should point to the project's venv  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. Add explicit dependency declaration:  \n   - If third-party: Include in `requirements.txt`  \n   - If local: Add to `setup.py` as an installable package with proper entry points  \n2. Implement environment validation in startup script:  \n   ```python\n   try:\n       import dexter_brain\n   except ImportError:\n       raise RuntimeError(\"Missing required module: dexter_brain. Install dependencies first.\")\n   ```  \n\nPrevention:  \n1. Add pre-startup dependency check to CI/CD pipeline  \n2. Use Docker containerization to ensure consistent environments  \n3. Implement monitoring for ImportError exceptions in production logs  \n4. Create automated test for module availability in integration tests  \n\nRisk_Level: LOW  \nConfidence: HIGH  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
