  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The stack trace shows it's happening in main.py line 120 when importing from dexter_brain.sandbox. So the immediate issue is a missing module.\n\nLooking at the system status, there are recent errors and critical ones. The error type is STARTUP_ERROR, which suggests the system can't start up properly because of this missing module. The context isn't available, so maybe the environment isn't set up correctly.\n\nRoot cause analysis: The module 'dexter_brain' isn't installed or not in the Python path. Maybe it's a custom module that's missing, or perhaps it's part of a package that wasn't installed correctly. Since the error occurs during startup, the system relies on this module to initialize, so its absence breaks the startup process.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if the module exists in the environment. If it's a third-party package, installing it via pip. If it's a local module, ensuring it's in the right directory and the Python path includes that location. Alternatively, if the module is part of the project, maybe the virtual environment isn't activated, or the dependencies aren't installed.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure the module is properly installed and included in the project's dependencies. If it's a custom module, making sure it's in the correct location and the project structure is set up to find it. Also, checking the requirements.txt or setup.py to include necessary dependencies.\n\nPrevention: Implement checks during deployment to verify all required modules are present. Using virtual environments to isolate dependencies, and ensuring that the CI/CD pipeline installs all dependencies correctly. Also, monitoring for missing modules during startup could help catch this earlier.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing module could be low if it's a known package. However, if 'dexter_brain' is a custom or proprietary module, there might be risks related to compatibility or security. Also, changing the Python path could have unintended consequences if not done carefully.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned \"dexter_brain\" â€“ that might be a specific module related to the system. If it's part of the project, maybe the code isn't properly structured. For example, if the module is in a subdirectory, the import might be incorrect. Or maybe the __init__.py file is missing, making Python not recognize it as a package.\n\nAnother angle: The error occurs on startup, so the system's entry point (main.py) is trying to import something that's not there. The solution would involve either installing the package, adding the module to the path, or fixing the import statement.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRoot Cause: The 'dexter_brain' module is missing from the Python environment or not in the correct location.\n\nImmediate Action: Check if the module exists, install it if it's a package, or adjust the Python path to include its location.\n\nPermanent Fix: Ensure the module is included in the project's dependencies and that the environment is set up correctly, possibly by using a virtual environment and proper installation steps.\n\nPrevention: Use dependency management tools, include all required modules in the project's setup, and implement pre-startup checks.\n\nRisk Level: LOW to MEDIUM. Installing a missing module is generally safe, but if the module has dependencies or conflicts, there could be issues. However, since the system is in healing mode, the risk is mitigated by the need to resolve the critical error.\n\nConfidence: HIGH, assuming that the module is indeed missing and can be installed or located properly.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because the Python interpreter cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons: (1) the module is not installed in the environment, (2) the module exists but is not in the Python path, or (3) the module is part of the project but misconfigured in the directory structure.\n\nImmediate_Action: \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' is a third-party package: Run `pip install dexter_brain` in the project's environment. \n2. If it's a local/custom module: \n   - Confirm its location (e.g., `M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\dexter_brain`)\n   - Ensure `__init__.py` exists in the directory to mark it as a package\n   - Add the directory to PYTHONPATH: `set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;M:\\gliksbot\\backend` (Windows) or `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/gliksbot/backend` (Linux/Mac)\n3. Restart the service/application after changes.\n\nPermanent_Fix: \n- If third-party: Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` and ensure it's installed during deployment.\n- If local: \n  - Structure the project to include 'dexter_brain' as a package in the root directory.\n  - Use relative imports or adjust `sys.path` in `main.py` to include the parent directory:  \n    ```python\n    import sys\n    sys.path.insert(0, 'M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\backend')\n    ```\n  - Implement a setup.py or pyproject.toml to package the module properly for distribution.\n\nPrevention: \n- Add pre-startup checks to validate required modules are importable.\n- Use virtual environments with pinned dependencies to ensure consistency.\n- Implement CI/CD pipeline steps to verify module availability during testing.\n\nRisk_Level: LOW  \nConfidence: HIGH  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
