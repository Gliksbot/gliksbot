  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The stack trace points to line 120 in main.py where it's trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox. So the immediate issue is a missing module.\n\nLooking at the error type, it's a STARTUP_ERROR, which happens during system initialization. The source is the system itself, so it's likely an environment or configuration problem. The context isn't available, so maybe the system didn't log any additional info.\n\nThe system status shows multiple recent errors and two critical ones, including this one. Related startup errors are two, so this might have happened before. The mission is to find the root cause, immediate actions, permanent fix, prevention, and risk assessment.\n\nRoot cause analysis: The module 'dexter_brain' isn't installed or not in the Python path. Possible reasons include missing installation, incorrect environment, virtual environment issues, or incorrect import path.\n\nImmediate action: Check if the module exists in the environment. If it's a package, install it using pip. If it's a local module, ensure it's in the right directory and the Python path includes it. Restart the service after fixing.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure the module is properly installed in the environment. If it's a dependency, add it to requirements.txt. If it's a local package, structure the project so that the module is importable, maybe by adjusting sys.path or using a package structure.\n\nPrevention: Implement dependency management, use virtual environments, monitor for missing modules during deployment, and have tests that check for required modules. Also, logging the environment details during startup could help diagnose such issues faster.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing module is low if it's a known package. However, if the module isn't supposed to be there, there might be a configuration issue. Confidence is high because this is a common issue with straightforward solutions.\n\nImplementation steps would involve checking the environment, installing the module if needed, adjusting the code if the import is incorrect, and updating deployment scripts to include dependencies.\n\nI should structure the response with Analysis, Approach, and Implementation sections. Also, check if any new skills are needed, but in this case, it's standard Python troubleshooting. So no SKILL_SPEC required.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., not in a directory listed in `sys.path`).  \n3. **Virtual Environment Issue**: The code is running in a virtual environment where the module is not installed.  \n4. **Typo/Misnaming**: A typo in the module name or incorrect import path (e.g., `dexter_brain` vs. `dexter_brain.sandbox`).  \n\n**Impact**:  \nThe system fails to start, leading to service unavailability. Critical errors (2 total) suggest this may be recurring or part of a broader configuration issue.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Immediate Verification**:  \n   - Confirm the existence of the `dexter_brain` module in the environment.  \n   - Check if the module is installed (`pip list | grep dexter_brain`) or exists in the project directory.  \n2. **Environment Check**:  \n   - Ensure the correct Python environment (virtual or global) is being used.  \n3. **Path Validation**:  \n   - Verify that the module’s directory is included in `sys.path`.  \n4. **Dependency Management**:  \n   - Add the module to `requirements.txt` if it’s a third-party package.  \n5. **Code Review**:  \n   - Check for typos in the import statement (`from dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox`).  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### **Immediate Action**  \n1. **Check Module Installation**:  \n   ```bash  \n   # Check installed packages  \n   pip list | grep dexter_brain  \n   # If missing, install (if it's a third-party package)  \n   pip install dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If the module is local (e.g., a custom package), ensure it is in the project directory and the path is correct.  \n\n2. **Verify Python Environment**:  \n   ```bash  \n   # Check current Python environment  \n   which python  # Linux/macOS  \n   where python  # Windows  \n   ```  \n   Ensure the environment matches where dependencies are installed.  \n\n3. **Add Module to Python Path (Temporary Fix)**:  \n   If the module exists but is not in the path, modify `main.py` to add its directory:  \n   ```python  \n   import sys  \n   sys.path.append(\"/path/to/dexter_brain\")  \n   ```  \n\n4. **Restart Service**:  \n   ```bash  \n   systemctl restart gliksbot  # Example for Linux service  \n   ```  \n\n---\n\n#### **Permanent Fix**  \n1. **Install Missing Dependency**:  \n   If `dexter_brain` is a third-party package:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   Add it to `requirements.txt`:  \n   ```  \n   dexter_brain==<version>  \n   ```  \n\n2. **Structure Project for Local Modules**:  \n   If `dexter_brain` is a local package, ensure it is in a directory listed in `sys.path` or structure the project as a package:  \n   ```bash  \n   # Example directory structure  \n   project_root/  \n   ├── dexter_brain/  \n   │   ├── __init__.py  \n   │   └── sandbox.py  \n   └── main.py  \n   ```  \n   Install the local package in development mode:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install -e .  \n   ```  \n\n3. **Update Deployment Scripts**:  \n   Ensure deployment processes install dependencies via `requirements.txt`:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install -r requirements.txt  \n   ```  \n\n---\n\n#### **Prevention**  \n1. **Dependency Management**:  \n   - Use `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile` to track dependencies.  \n   - Automate dependency installation in CI/CD pipelines.  \n2. **Environment Isolation**:  \n   - Use virtual environments (e.g., `venv`) to avoid conflicts.  \n3. **Monitoring**:  \n   - Implement logging for module import errors during startup.  \n   - Set up alerts for `ModuleNotFoundError` in logs.  \n4. **Code Testing**:  \n   - Add unit tests to verify critical imports.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Risk Assessment**  \n- **Risk Level**: **LOW**  \n  Installing a missing module or adjusting paths is low-risk if the module is trusted.  \n- **Confidence**: **HIGH**  \n  This is a common Python error with well-established solutions.  \n\n---\n\n### Final Proposal  \n**Collaboration Session ID**: heal_err_1757070588039_1_1757087733  \n**Vote**: ✅ Approved (Balances speed, safety, and correctness).  \n\nNo new skills required. Standard Python troubleshooting suffices."
