The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The traceback shows it's happening in main.py line 120 during the startup_event. The module 'dexter_brain' is missing.\n\nLooking at the system status, there are 202 recent errors and 2 critical ones, with 2 related startup errors. So this might be a recurring issue. The context isn't available, which might make it harder, but maybe the error itself gives enough clues.\n\nRoot Cause: The most likely reason is that the 'dexter_brain' module isn't installed in the Python environment where the application is running. Alternatively, it might be installed in a different environment, or the Python path isn't set correctly. Another possibility is that the module is part of a package that wasn't properly installed or is missing from the project dependencies.\n\nImmediate Action: The user needs to check if 'dexter_brain' is installed. They can run 'pip show dexter_brain' to see if it's present. If not, installing it would be the first step. But maybe the module is a local package, so they might need to ensure that the directory containing 'dexter_brain' is in the PYTHONPATH. Alternatively, if it's a custom module, they might have to reinstall the project dependencies or check the import paths.\n\nPermanent Fix: If the module is a third-party package, adding it to the requirements.txt and ensuring it's installed in the environment would fix it. If it's a local module, making sure the project structure is correct and that the module is in the right location relative to where it's being imported. Maybe the project uses a virtual environment, and the module isn't installed there. Also, checking for typos in the import statement.\n\nPrevention: Implementing dependency management to ensure all required modules are listed and installed. Using virtual environments to isolate dependencies. Adding checks in the CI/CD pipeline to verify that all imports are valid before deployment. Monitoring for missing modules during startup.\n\nRisk Assessment: The risk of installing a missing module could be low if it's a known package. However, if 'dexter_brain' is a custom module, there might be compatibility issues. Also, if the module isn't supposed to be there, installing it might introduce security risks. But given the error, it's necessary.\n\nNow, putting this into the required format. The root cause is the missing module. Immediate action would be installing it or adjusting the path. Permanent fix would be ensuring dependencies are managed. Prevention through better dependency tracking and testing. Risk level is low if the module is legitimate.\n\nWait, but the error is in the system source, so maybe the module is part of the system's own code. If 'dexter_brain' is a local package, then the issue could be that the project isn't structured correctly, or the Python path isn't including the necessary directories. For example, if the module is in a sibling directory, the import might fail unless the root is in the path. So checking the project structure and PYTHONPATH setup is important.\n\nIn that case, the immediate action might involve checking the file structure, ensuring that the 'dexter_brain' directory is present and has an __init__.py file. If it's missing, restoring it from version control or reinstalling the package. If the path is incorrect, modifying the sys.path in the code to include the correct directory.\n\nPermanent fix could involve setting up the project with proper package structure, using setup.py or pyproject.toml to install the package in development mode. That way, the imports work as expected.\n\nPrevention would include adding tests that check for the existence of required modules, or using linters to catch import errors before deployment.\n\nRisk level would be low if the fix is just adding the module to the path or installing it, but higher if there's a deeper issue with the project setup.\n\nSo, putting all this together into the response format.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because Python cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. The module is a local package whose directory is not in the Python path.  \n3. A typo or incorrect import path in the code.  \n\nGiven the error context and stack trace, the most probable root cause is either a missing installation of a third-party package or an incorrect project structure where the local 'dexter_brain' module is not properly referenced.  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' is a third-party package:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip show dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If not found, install it (if applicable):  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n2. If 'dexter_brain' is a local module:  \n   - Confirm its directory exists in the project (e.g., `M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\dexter_brain`).  \n   - Ensure `__init__.py` exists in the directory to mark it as a package.  \n   - Add the root directory to `PYTHONPATH`:  \n     ```bash  \n     set PYTHONPATH=M:\\gliksbot\\backend;%PYTHONPATH%  \n     ```  \n3. Restart the application after adjustments.  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. **For third-party packages**:  \n   - Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` and ensure it is installed in the environment:  \n     ```bash  \n     echo \"dexter_brain==<version>\" >> requirements.txt  \n     pip install -r requirements.txt  \n     ```  \n2. **For local modules**:  \n   - Structure the project as a package with `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` to install it in development mode:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install -e .  \n     ```  \n   - Use relative imports or adjust `sys.path` programmatically if necessary.  \n\nPrevention:  \n- Integrate dependency checks in CI/CD pipelines (e.g., `pip check` or `pylint` to validate imports).  \n- Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies and ensure consistency.  \n- Monitor startup logs for `ModuleNotFoundError` and alert on occurrences.  \n\nRisk_Level: LOW  \nConfidence: HIGH  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
