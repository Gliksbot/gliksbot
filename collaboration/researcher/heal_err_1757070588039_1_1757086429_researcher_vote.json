  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user is getting a ModuleNotFoundError for 'dexter_brain' when starting up. The error is critical and happening during startup, so the system can't initialize properly.\n\nFirst, the root cause. The error message says the module isn't found. That usually means the package isn't installed, or there's an issue with the Python path. Since the error is in the startup_event function trying to import from 'dexter_brain.sandbox', it's possible that the 'dexter_brain' package isn't installed in the current environment. Alternatively, maybe the package is installed but in a different directory that's not in the Python path. Or perhaps there's a typo in the module name, but the error message shows the exact name, so that's less likely.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if the package is installed. The user can run 'pip show dexter_brain' or 'pip list' to see if it's present. If it's not there, installing it would be the first step. If it is installed, maybe the environment is pointing to the wrong Python interpreter where the package isn't installed. They might need to check their virtual environment activation or the PATH variable.\n\nFor a permanent fix, ensuring that the package is included in the project's dependencies. If it's a third-party package, adding it to requirements.txt or pyproject.toml. If it's an internal package, making sure it's properly installed in development mode (like using pip install -e .). Also, checking the project's structure to ensure that the module is in a directory that's part of the Python path.\n\nPrevention would involve setting up proper dependency management, maybe using virtual environments for each project, and ensuring that all dependencies are listed and version-controlled. Also, implementing checks in the CI/CD pipeline to verify that all required modules are present before deployment. Monitoring for missing modules during startup could help catch these issues early.\n\nRisks of the solution: If installing the package introduces conflicts with other dependencies, that could cause new issues. So checking compatibility is important. Also, if the package isn't maintained, there might be security risks or future compatibility issues. The confidence here would be high if the package is known and trusted, but maybe medium if there's uncertainty about its source.\n\nSo putting it all together, the analysis would point to a missing package. Immediate action is installing it. Permanent fix is adding it to dependencies. Prevention through dependency management and checks. Risk level low if the package is safe, confidence high if the user is certain about the package's availability and correctness.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because the Python interpreter cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. The package is not installed in the current environment  \n2. The package is installed but not in the Python path  \n3. A version mismatch or incorrect installation  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify package installation: Run `pip show dexter_brain` in the project's environment  \n2. If missing, install it: `pip install dexter-brain` (or specific version if required)  \n3. If installed but not found, check Python path:  \n   - Add directory containing `dexter_brain` to PYTHONPATH:  \n     `set PYTHONPATH=M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\path_to_dexter_brain %PYTHONPATH%`  \n4. Restart service: `systemctl restart gliksbot` (or equivalent for the runtime environment)  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. Add `dexter-brain` to project dependencies in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`  \n2. If it's an internal package, install in development mode:  \n   `pip install -e M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\path_to_dexter_brain`  \n3. Validate environment setup in CI/CD pipeline to ensure consistent installations  \n\nPrevention:  \n1. Implement dependency validation script in startup sequence:  \n   ```python\n   try:\n       import dexter_brain\n   except ImportError:\n       raise RuntimeError(\"Missing dependency: dexter_brain\")\n   ```  \n2. Add pre-deployment check to verify all imports in critical files  \n3. Monitor for ModuleNotFoundError patterns in logs with alerting  \n\nRisk_Level: LOW  \nConfidence: HIGH  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
