  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to parse through that. The error is a STARTUP_ERROR with the message \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". The stack trace points to main.py line 120 trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nFirst, the root cause. The error is a ModuleNotFoundError, which usually means the module isn't installed or not in the Python path. So, the dexter_brain module isn't available in the environment where the code is running. Possible reasons: the module isn't installed, it's installed in a different environment, or there's a typo in the import. But since the error is consistent (Recent Errors: 8, Critical: 2), it's likely a missing dependency.\n\nImmediate action: The user needs to install the missing module. But how? If dexter_brain is a third-party package, they can pip install it. If it's a local module, maybe it's not in the right directory or not added to the Python path. They should check the project structure. Also, checking if there's a virtual environment that's not activated.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure that the dexter_brain module is properly installed and available in the environment. If it's a package, include it in the requirements.txt. If it's part of the project, make sure it's in the correct location and the Python path is set correctly. Maybe the project structure changed, or the module was moved.\n\nPrevention: Add checks during deployment to ensure all dependencies are installed. Use virtual environments and dependency management tools. Implement automated testing that includes startup tests to catch missing modules early. Also, monitoring for similar errors in the future.\n\nRisk assessment: Installing a new module could introduce conflicts, but if it's a required dependency, the risk is low. If the module isn't maintained, there might be issues, but that's a separate concern.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned \"Collaborate to diagnose and provide healing solutions\". So I need to structure the answer according to the sections they specified: Analysis, Immediate Action, Permanent Fix, Prevention, Risk Level, Confidence.\n\nIn the Analysis, I should state that the root cause is the missing dexter_brain module. Immediate Action would be installing the module or adding it to the path. Permanent Fix could be updating dependencies or project structure. Prevention through dependency management and testing. Risk Level is LOW since installing a required module is standard. Confidence HIGH if the module exists and is accessible.\n\nWait, but what if dexter_brain is a custom module that's supposed to be part of the project? Then the issue might be that the module isn't in the right directory. The user's code is in M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\main.py. So maybe the dexter_brain package is supposed to be in the same directory or a parent directory. If the project structure changed, the import might be broken. So checking the file system to ensure that dexter_brain is present where Python can find it.\n\nSo possible solutions: install via pip if it's a package, or adjust the Python path to include the directory containing dexter_brain. Alternatively, if the module is missing, the team needs to restore it from version control or another source.\n\nIn the Implementation section, the user might need steps like checking the module's presence, installing it, or modifying sys.path. Also, checking for typos in the import statement.\n\nSo putting it all together, the Analysis would be that the module is missing. Immediate action: install or add to path. Permanent fix: ensure module is included in the project and dependencies. Prevention: use requirements.txt and testing. Risk is low. Confidence high.\n</think>\n\n### **Analysis**  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., misplaced in the project directory).  \n3. **Dependency Conflict**: A required dependency for `dexter_brain` is missing or incompatible.  \n\n**Context**:  \n- The error occurs during startup (`startup_event` in `main.py`), suggesting a critical dependency failure.  \n- No context is available, implying potential gaps in deployment or environment configuration.  \n\n---\n\n### **Approach**  \n1. **Immediate Mitigation**:  \n   - Verify the existence and location of the `dexter_brain` module.  \n   - Install or link the module to the environment.  \n2. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Ensure `dexter_brain` is included in the project’s dependency management (e.g., `requirements.txt`).  \n   - Validate the project structure and Python path configuration.  \n3. **Prevention**:  \n   - Implement automated dependency checks during deployment.  \n   - Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies.  \n\n---\n\n### **Implementation**  \n\n#### **Immediate_Action**  \n1. **Check Module Availability**:  \n   - Run `dir(dexter_brain)` in a Python shell to confirm if the module exists.  \n   - If missing, check the project repository for the `dexter_brain` directory or package.  \n\n2. **Install the Module**:  \n   - If `dexter_brain` is a third-party package:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install dexter_brain  \n     ```  \n   - If it’s a local module:  \n     - Ensure the directory containing `dexter_brain/__init__.py` is in the project root or add it to `PYTHONPATH`:  \n       ```bash  \n       export PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/dexter_brain\"  \n       ```  \n\n3. **Restart the Service**:  \n   - After installation, restart the backend service to apply changes.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Permanent_Fix**  \n1. **Update Dependency Management**:  \n   - Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` (if applicable):  \n     ```txt  \n     dexter_brain==<version>  \n     ```  \n   - If it’s a local module, ensure it’s included in the project repository and referenced correctly in `setup.py` or `__init__.py`.  \n\n2. **Validate Project Structure**:  \n   - Ensure the project directory includes `dexter_brain` at the root level or adjust imports accordingly.  \n\n3. **Environment Isolation**:  \n   - Use a virtual environment (e.g., `venv`) to avoid dependency conflicts:  \n     ```bash  \n     python -m venv venv  \n     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate  \n     pip install -r requirements.txt  \n     ```  \n\n---\n\n#### **Prevention**  \n1. **Automated Dependency Checks**:  \n   - Add a pre-startup script to validate dependencies:  \n     ```bash  \n     # Example: check_dexter_brain.sh  \n     python -c \"import dexter_brain\" || { echo \"Error: dexter_brain missing\"; exit 1; }  \n     ```  \n   - Integrate this into CI/CD pipelines.  \n\n2. **Monitoring and Alerts**:  \n   - Use tools like Prometheus or Sentry to monitor startup errors and trigger alerts for missing modules.  \n\n3. **Code Reviews**:  \n   - Enforce checks for new imports in code reviews to ensure dependencies are documented.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Risk Assessment**  \n- **Risk Level**: **LOW**  \n  - Installing a missing module is a standard procedure with minimal risk if the module is trusted.  \n- **Confidence**: **HIGH**  \n  - The solution directly addresses the `ModuleNotFoundError` and aligns with Python best practices.  \n\n---\n\n### **SKILL_SPEC (Optional)**  \nIf the team lacks Python environment management skills, provide training on:  \n- Virtual environments (`venv`, `pipenv`).  \n- Dependency management (`requirements.txt`, `setup.py`).  \n- Python path configuration.  \n\n**Example Code for Dependency Check**:  \n```python  \n# dependency_check.py  \ntry:  \n    import dexter_brain  \n    print(\"dexter_brain is installed and accessible.\")  \nexcept ImportError:  \n    print(\"ERROR: dexter_brain is missing. Install it using 'pip install dexter_brain' or add it to the project.\")  \n```  \n\nRun this script before startup to preempt errors."
