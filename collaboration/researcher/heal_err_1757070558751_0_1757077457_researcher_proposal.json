  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to parse through it carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The traceback shows it's happening in main.py during the startup_event, specifically when importing from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nLooking at the error details: it's a STARTUP_ERROR of CRITICAL severity. The system tried once, and there are 2 related startup errors. Recent errors total 7, with 2 critical. The context isn't available, which might make it a bit harder, but the stack trace gives a good clue.\n\nRoot cause analysis: The most likely reasons are that the dexter_brain module isn't installed, not in the Python path, or there's a typo in the import statement. Since the error is during startup, it's probably a missing dependency or incorrect environment setup.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if the module exists. If it's a local module, maybe it's not in the right directory. If it's a package, perhaps it wasn't installed. The user might need to install it via pip or ensure the environment is correctly set up.\n\nPermanent fix could involve adding the module to the project's dependencies, ensuring it's included in the requirements.txt, or setting up the environment properly. If it's a custom module, making sure the directory structure is correct so Python can find it.\n\nPrevention would include adding checks during deployment to ensure all dependencies are installed, using virtual environments, and maybe implementing automated tests that check for missing modules before deployment.\n\nRisk assessment: The immediate action of installing the module might have a low risk if it's a known package. However, if the module isn't supposed to be there, there might be a configuration issue. The permanent fix of updating dependencies could introduce new issues if the module has breaking changes, so that's a medium risk.\n\nI should also consider the system's source and load. Since it's a startup error, the system isn't running, so any fix would require restarting. The team might need to check the environment variables, PYTHONPATH, and the location of the dexter_brain module.\n\nIf the module is part of the project, maybe it's in a subdirectory that's not included in the Python path. Adding the parent directory to sys.path in main.py could help. Alternatively, if it's a third-party package, installing it via pip would be necessary.\n\nFor the SKILL_SPEC, if the team needs to check the environment or install packages, they might need to write a script to verify the module's presence or automate the installation. But since the user is asking for a solution proposal, maybe the steps are more about manual checks and corrections.\n\nIn the implementation, the immediate action would be to install the module or adjust the path. The permanent fix would involve ensuring the environment is set up correctly, maybe through a setup script or Docker container. Prevention could include adding linter checks or CI/CD steps to validate imports.\n\nI need to structure the response into Analysis, Approach, and Implementation as per the user's request. Make sure each section addresses the required points clearly and concisely.\n</think>\n\n# Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that Python cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to:  \n1. Missing installation of the `dexter_brain` package (if it’s a third-party dependency).  \n2. Incorrect Python path configuration (if `dexter_brain` is a local/custom module not in the project directory).  \n3. Broken or misconfigured virtual environment.  \n\n**Immediate Action**:  \n1. Verify if `dexter_brain` is a third-party package or a local module.  \n2. If third-party: Install it via `pip install dexter_brain` (or check the correct package name).  \n3. If local: Ensure the module’s directory is in the Python path (e.g., add its parent directory to `sys.path` in `main.py`).  \n\n**Permanent Fix**:  \n1. **For third-party modules**: Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` to ensure it’s installed in all environments.  \n2. **For local modules**:  \n   - Ensure the module’s directory is included in the project’s root or adjust the import path.  \n   - Use relative imports or modify `sys.path` programmatically.  \n3. Containerize the application (e.g., Docker) to standardize environments.  \n\n**Prevention**:  \n1. Implement dependency checks during CI/CD pipelines (e.g., run `pip check` or `python -m py_compile` to validate imports).  \n2. Use linters (e.g., `pylint`, `flake8`) to flag missing imports during development.  \n3. Monitor startup logs for `ModuleNotFoundError` and alert on failures.  \n\n**Risk Assessment**:  \n- **Immediate Action Risk**: LOW (installing a missing package or adjusting paths is low-risk if validated).  \n- **Permanent Fix Risk**: MEDIUM (modifying paths or dependencies could introduce conflicts if not tested).  \n\n---\n\n# Approach  \n1. **Diagnosis**:  \n   - Check if `dexter_brain` exists in the environment (`pip list | grep dexter_brain` or `ls` the project directory).  \n   - Validate the import path in `main.py` (e.g., `from dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox`).  \n\n2. **Resolution**:  \n   - If missing: Install or link the module.  \n   - If present but not found: Adjust `PYTHONPATH` or `sys.path`.  \n\n3. **Automation**:  \n   - Use infrastructure-as-code (e.g., Terraform, Ansible) to ensure environment consistency.  \n\n---\n\n# Implementation  \n\n### Immediate Action (Concrete Steps):  \n1. **Check Environment**:  \n   ```bash  \n   # Check installed packages  \n   pip list | grep dexter_brain  \n\n   # Check local directory structure  \n   ls M:\\gliksbot\\backend/  \n   ```  \n\n2. **Install or Link Module**:  \n   - If third-party:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install dexter_brain  \n     ```  \n   - If local:  \n     ```python  \n     # Add to main.py (temporary fix)  \n     import sys  \n     sys.path.append(\"M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\\")  # Adjust path to include dexter_brain's parent directory  \n     ```  \n\n3. **Restart Service**:  \n   ```bash  \n   # Example for a systemd service  \n   systemctl restart gliksbot  \n   ```  \n\n### Permanent Fix:  \n1. **Update Dependencies**:  \n   ```bash  \n   # Add to requirements.txt  \n   echo \"dexter_brain==<version>\" >> requirements.txt  \n   pip install -r requirements.txt  \n   ```  \n\n2. **Adjust Project Structure (if local module)**:  \n   - Move `dexter_brain` to the project root or use a package structure:  \n     ```bash  \n     M:\\gliksbot\\  \n     ├── backend\\  \n     │   └── main.py  \n     └── dexter_brain\\  \n         ├── __init__.py  \n         └── sandbox.py  \n     ```  \n\n3. **Containerize (Optional)**:  \n   ```dockerfile  \n   # Dockerfile  \n   FROM python:3.9  \n   WORKDIR /app  \n   COPY requirements.txt .  \n   RUN pip install -r requirements.txt  \n   COPY . .  \n   CMD [\"python\", \"backend/main.py\"]  \n   ```  \n\n### Prevention:  \n1. **CI/CD Pipeline Check**:  \n   ```yaml  \n   # GitHub Actions example  \n   jobs:  \n     build:  \n       runs-on: ubuntu-latest  \n       steps:  \n         - name: Check dependencies  \n           run: |  \n             pip install -r requirements.txt  \n             python -c \"import dexter_brain\"  \n   ```  \n\n2. **Monitoring**:  \n   - Use tools like Prometheus + Grafana to track startup errors.  \n   - Set up alerts for `ModuleNotFoundError` in logs.  \n\n### Risk Mitigation:  \n- Test fixes in a staging environment before production.  \n- Use version pinning in `requirements.txt` to avoid breaking changes.  \n\n--- \n\n**Confidence**: HIGH (solution addresses common causes of `ModuleNotFoundError`).  \n**Next Steps**: Validate the fix by restarting the service and monitoring logs."
