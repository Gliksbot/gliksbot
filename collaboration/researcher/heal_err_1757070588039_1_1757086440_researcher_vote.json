  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a ModuleNotFoundError for 'dexter_brain' when starting up the system. The error is a STARTUP_ERROR with CRITICAL severity, so it's pretty serious. The stack trace points to main.py trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out why Python can't find the dexter_brain module. Common reasons for this are that the module isn't installed, the Python path isn't set correctly, or there's a typo in the import statement. Since the error is happening during startup, it's likely that the module isn't installed in the current environment.\n\nLooking at the context, there's no context available, so I have to make some assumptions. The system might be a Python application where 'dexter_brain' is a custom module or a third-party library. If it's a custom module, it should be in the same directory or a subdirectory that's part of the Python path. If it's a third-party library, it might not be installed in the current environment.\n\nImmediate actions would involve checking if the module exists in the environment. The user could run a pip list to see if dexter_brain is installed. If not, installing it would be the next step. Alternatively, if it's a local module, ensuring that the Python path includes the directory where dexter_brain is located.\n\nFor a permanent fix, if the module is missing, installing it via pip or adding it to the project's dependencies would be necessary. If it's a local module, making sure that the directory structure is correct and that the __init__.py files are present so that Python recognizes it as a package.\n\nPrevention could involve setting up a requirements.txt file that includes all necessary dependencies, including dexter_brain, so that the environment can be reproducibly set up. Also, using virtual environments to isolate dependencies and ensure that all required packages are installed.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing module is generally low if it's a known dependency. However, if the module isn't maintained or has compatibility issues, there could be risks. But since the system is expecting it, it's probably safe to install.\n\nConfidence in this solution is high because the error is straightforwardâ€”missing module. The steps to resolve are standard Python troubleshooting.\n\nSo putting it all together: The root cause is the missing module. Immediate action is to install it or adjust the Python path. Permanent fix is ensuring dependencies are properly managed. Prevention through requirements files and environment setup. Low risk, high confidence.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because the Python interpreter cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This module is likely a critical dependency for system initialization. Common root causes include:  \n1. Missing installation of the 'dexter_brain' package  \n2. Incorrect Python path configuration preventing module discovery  \n3. Version mismatch between installed packages and system requirements  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify module existence: Run `pip show dexter_brain` to check if installed  \n2. If missing, install via pip: `pip install dexter-brain` (or specific version if required)  \n3. If module exists locally but not recognized, temporarily add its directory to PYTHONPATH:  \n   `set PYTHONPATH=M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\path_to_dexter_brain` (Windows)  \n   `export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/dexter_brain` (Linux/Mac)  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. Ensure 'dexter_brain' is listed in `requirements.txt` with exact version:  \n   `dexter-brain==X.Y.Z`  \n2. Implement dependency management:  \n   - Use virtual environments (e.g., `venv`)  \n   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` during deployment  \n3. If 'dexter_brain' is an internal module:  \n   - Structure project to include it in the package  \n   - Add `__init__.py` files to make directories importable  \n   - Use relative imports or adjust `sys.path` in code  \n\nPrevention:  \n1. Add pre-startup check for required modules in `main.py`:  \n   ```python\n   try:\n       import dexter_brain\n   except ImportError:\n       raise RuntimeError(\"Missing dependency: dexter_brain. Install requirements.txt\")\n   ```  \n2. Implement CI/CD pipeline checks for dependency resolution  \n3. Monitor missing module errors via logging/alerting system  \n\nRisk_Level: LOW  \nConfidence: HIGH  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
