  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a ModuleNotFoundError for 'dexter_brain' when starting up their system. The error is critical and happening during startup, which means the system can't initialize properly.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out why Python can't find the 'dexter_brain' module. Common reasons for this are that the module isn't installed, there's a typo in the name, or the Python path isn't set correctly. Since the error is happening in the startup_event in main.py, it's trying to import from 'dexter_brain.sandbox' which doesn't exist in the current environment.\n\nLooking at the context, there's no context available, so maybe the environment where this is running doesn't have the necessary packages installed. The system status shows recent errors and critical ones, so this might be a recurring issue. The related startup errors are two, so this might have happened before.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if 'dexter_brain' is installed. If not, install it. But since the user might not have it in their environment, maybe it's a local module that's missing. Alternatively, the Python path might not include the directory where 'dexter_brain' is located. So, checking the installed packages and the PYTHONPATH could help.\n\nFor a permanent fix, ensuring that the module is properly installed in the environment, or adding the correct path to sys.path in the code. Also, checking the requirements.txt or setup.py to include the necessary dependencies. If 'dexter_brain' is a third-party package, installing it via pip. If it's a local module, making sure it's in the right directory and the path is set.\n\nPrevention could involve adding checks during deployment to ensure all dependencies are installed, using virtual environments, and setting up monitoring to alert when modules are missing. Also, including the module in version control if it's a local package.\n\nRisk assessment: The immediate action of installing a package might introduce new dependencies or conflicts, but if it's a required module, it's necessary. The permanent fix of modifying the Python path could have risks if not done correctly, but it's manageable. The prevention steps are low risk and good practice.\n\nSo putting it all together, the root cause is the missing module. Immediate action is to install or link the module. Permanent fix is ensuring dependencies are included in the environment setup. Prevention through monitoring and dependency management. Risks are medium if installing third-party packages, but low if it's a local module.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because the Python interpreter cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during system startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. The module is not installed in the current Python environment  \n2. The module's directory is not in the Python path  \n3. There's a typo/mismatch in the module name  \n\nGiven the error context and stack trace, this appears to be a missing dependency or path configuration issue rather than a code typo (since the error is consistent across multiple startup attempts).  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' is a local module or third-party package  \n2. If third-party: Run `pip install dexter_brain` (or `pip3` depending on environment)  \n3. If local:  \n   a. Confirm the module's directory exists in the project structure  \n   b. Add the directory to PYTHONPATH:  \n      ```bash  \n      export PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/dexter_brain_parent_directory\"  \n      ```  \n4. Restart the service:  \n   ```bash  \n   systemctl restart gliksbot.service  # or appropriate restart command  \n   ```  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. For third-party packages:  \n   - Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt`  \n   - Implement dependency installation in deployment pipeline  \n2. For local modules:  \n   - Ensure module directory is included in version control  \n   - Modify `main.py` to dynamically add the path:  \n     ```python  \n     import sys  \n     sys.path.append(\"/absolute/path/to/dexter_brain_parent_directory\")  \n     ```  \n   - Or create a package with `__init__.py` and install it via `pip install -e .`  \n\nPrevention:  \n1. Add pre-startup health checks to verify critical module availability  \n2. Implement dependency validation in CI/CD pipeline  \n3. Use virtual environments with pinned dependencies  \n4. Monitor for ModuleNotFoundError patterns in logs with alerting  \n\nRisk_Level: MEDIUM  \n- Risk of dependency conflicts when installing new packages  \n- Path modifications could introduce environment-specific issues  \n\nConfidence: HIGH  \n- Solution directly addresses the root cause  \n- Standard Python module resolution practices applied  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
