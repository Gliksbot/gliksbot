  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to parse through that first. The error is a STARTUP_ERROR with the message \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". The traceback shows it's happening in main.py when trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nHmm, the root cause here is probably that the 'dexter_brain' module isn't installed or not in the Python path. Since it's a startup error, the system can't initialize because it's missing this dependency. The immediate action would be to check if the module exists in the environment. If not, install it. But how?\n\nWait, the user mentioned it's a critical error with attempts 1/3. So the system might retry, but the problem remains. The permanent fix would involve ensuring the module is properly installed and accessible. Maybe the virtual environment isn't activated, or the package isn't installed there. Or perhaps the module is a local package that's missing from the project structure.\n\nLooking at the context, there's no context available, so I have to assume standard Python setup. The system status shows recent errors, so this might be a recurring issue. The mission is to diagnose and provide healing solutions. So steps would be: check installation, verify paths, install if missing, then ensure it's included in the environment.\n\nFor prevention, maybe setting up dependency checks during deployment, or using a requirements.txt file. Also, monitoring for missing modules during startup. Risk assessment: installing a missing module could introduce compatibility issues, but if it's part of the project, it's necessary. The risk level would be medium if the module is trusted, but high if it's from an untrusted source.\n\nWait, the user wants specific implementation steps. So in Immediate Action, I should list commands like checking Python path, installing the package, or adding the directory to PYTHONPATH. Permanent fix could involve adding the module to the project's dependencies, maybe via pip install or including it in the repo. Prevention might include automated checks in CI/CD pipelines.\n\nAlso, considering the error is in the backend's main.py, the 'dexter_brain' might be a custom module. If it's a third-party package, installing via pip. If it's local, ensuring the directory is in the Python path. The user might need to check the project structure. So the analysis should cover both possibilities.\n\nI need to structure the response into Analysis, Approach, and Implementation. The Analysis would outline possible causes: missing module, incorrect Python path, environment issues. Approach would be steps to verify and install. Implementation details the commands or changes needed.\n\nAlso, the special considerations mention prioritizing solutions that don't disrupt operations. So maybe restarting the service after installation, but ensuring minimal downtime. Risk assessment for each solution step.\n\nI think that's the direction. Now, structure the answer accordingly.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This typically occurs due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Python Path**: The module’s directory is not included in the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.  \n3. **Environment Misconfiguration**: The virtual environment (if used) is not activated, or dependencies are installed in a different environment.  \n4. **Custom Module Missing**: If `dexter_brain` is a local/custom module, it may be missing from the project directory.  \n\n**Contextual Clues**:  \n- The error occurs in `main.py` during the `startup_event`, suggesting `dexter_brain` is a critical dependency for system initialization.  \n- No context is available, implying the issue might be environment-specific (e.g., deployment vs. development).  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Verify Module Installation**:  \n   - Check if `dexter_brain` is installed in the current environment.  \n   - If it’s a third-party package, install it via `pip`.  \n   - If it’s a local module, ensure its directory is accessible.  \n\n2. **Check Python Path**:  \n   - Confirm that the directory containing `dexter_brain` is in the `PYTHONPATH`.  \n\n3. **Environment Validation**:  \n   - Ensure the correct Python environment is active (e.g., virtualenv, conda).  \n\n4. **Preventive Measures**:  \n   - Automate dependency checks during deployment.  \n   - Use `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile` to standardize dependencies.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### **Immediate Action**  \n1. **Check Installed Packages**:  \n   ```bash  \n   # List installed packages to verify presence of 'dexter_brain'  \n   pip list | grep dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n\n2. **Install Missing Module**:  \n   - If it’s a third-party package:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install dexter_brain  \n     ```  \n   - If it’s a local module:  \n     - Ensure the module’s directory is in the project root or add it to `PYTHONPATH`:  \n       ```bash  \n       export PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/dexter_brain\"  \n       ```  \n\n3. **Restart Service**:  \n   ```bash  \n   # Example for systemd service  \n   sudo systemctl restart gliksbot-backend  \n   ```  \n\n#### **Permanent Fix**  \n1. **Standardize Dependencies**:  \n   - Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt`:  \n     ```txt  \n     # requirements.txt  \n     dexter_brain==<version>  # Specify version if applicable  \n     ```  \n   - Use a dependency manager (e.g., `pip-tools`, `poetry`) to enforce consistency.  \n\n2. **Update Deployment Scripts**:  \n   - Ensure deployment pipelines install dependencies automatically:  \n     ```bash  \n     # Example in Dockerfile  \n     COPY requirements.txt .  \n     RUN pip install -r requirements.txt  \n     ```  \n\n3. **Validate Module Path**:  \n   - If `dexter_brain` is local, structure the project to include it in the root directory or use relative imports.  \n\n#### **Prevention**  \n1. **Automated Checks**:  \n   - Add a pre-startup script to validate dependencies:  \n     ```bash  \n     # check_dependencies.sh  \n     python -c \"import dexter_brain\" || { echo \"Missing dexter_brain\"; exit 1; }  \n     ```  \n\n2. **Monitoring**:  \n   - Implement logging for module import errors during startup.  \n   - Set up alerts for `ModuleNotFoundError` in monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Sentry).  \n\n3. **Environment Isolation**:  \n   - Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies and avoid conflicts.  \n\n---\n\n### Risk Assessment  \n- **Risk Level**: **MEDIUM**  \n  - Installing a missing module could introduce compatibility issues if the version is incorrect.  \n  - Modifying `PYTHONPATH` might affect other services if not scoped properly.  \n- **Confidence**: **HIGH**  \n  - The solution addresses common causes of `ModuleNotFoundError` and aligns with Python best practices.  \n\n---\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (Optional)  \nIf the team lacks Python environment management skills, provide training on:  \n- Virtual environments (`venv`, `conda`).  \n- Dependency management (`pip`, `poetry`).  \n- Environment variable configuration.  \n\n**Code Example for Dependency Check**:  \n```python  \n# dependency_checker.py  \ntry:  \n    import dexter_brain  \n    print(\"Dependency 'dexter_brain' is installed and accessible.\")  \nexcept ImportError:  \n    print(\"ERROR: 'dexter_brain' is missing. Install it using 'pip install dexter_brain'.\")  \n```  \n\nRun this script during deployment to validate dependencies."
