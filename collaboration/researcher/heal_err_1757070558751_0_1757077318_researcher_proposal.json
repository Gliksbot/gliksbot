  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to parse through that. The error is a STARTUP_ERROR with the message \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". The stack trace points to main.py trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nFirst, the root cause. The error is a ModuleNotFoundError, which usually means that the required Python module isn't installed or isn't in the Python path. So, the 'dexter_brain' module is missing in the environment where the application is running. That could be because it wasn't installed, or maybe it's installed in a different environment, or the path is incorrect.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if the module exists. If it's a package that needs to be installed, using pip install might work. But since the error is during startup, maybe the module isn't part of the standard dependencies. Alternatively, if 'dexter_brain' is a local module, the project structure might be incorrect, or the Python path isn't set up properly. So, the immediate steps could be to verify the installation, check the Python path, or manually add the path if needed.\n\nFor a permanent fix, ensuring that the module is included in the project's dependencies. If it's a third-party package, adding it to requirements.txt. If it's a local module, making sure the directory is in the Python path, perhaps by installing the project in development mode or adjusting sys.path in the code. Also, checking the project structure to ensure that the module is in the right location relative to where main.py is running.\n\nPrevention would involve setting up proper dependency management, using virtual environments, and including all necessary modules in the deployment process. Also, adding checks during the startup to verify that all required modules are present, which could log warnings or errors early. Maybe implementing a linter or a pre-commit hook that checks for missing imports.\n\nRisk assessment: The immediate action of installing a package might have risks if the package isn't trusted or if it's a version that conflicts with other dependencies. Manually modifying the Python path could lead to issues if the path is not correctly set in different environments. The permanent fix of adjusting the project structure or dependencies should be low risk if done correctly, but could introduce issues if not tested properly.\n\nNow, considering the special considerations: the system source is 'system', so maybe this is a core component. The error is critical, so any fix needs to be reliable. The solution should be implementable without disrupting ongoing operations, so perhaps a hotfix that doesn't require a full redeploy, like installing the missing module in the current environment.\n\nWait, but the error is during startup, so if the module is missing, the system can't start. So immediate action would be to install the module. But how? If it's a package available on PyPI, then pip install dexter_brain. But if it's a custom module, maybe it's part of the project that wasn't included. The user might need to check the repository to see if 'dexter_brain' is a submodule or a separate package.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to import a module that's supposed to be in the same directory but the working directory is different. So checking the file structure and sys.path settings.\n\nIn the implementation steps, the user should first check if 'dexter_brain' is a package that can be installed. If not, check the project structure. If it's a local module, ensure that the directory containing 'dexter_brain' is in the Python path. This can be done by adding the directory to PYTHONPATH environment variable or modifying sys.path in main.py before the import.\n\nFor the permanent fix, if it's a local module, the project should be structured so that the module is in a location that's automatically included, or the setup.py should include it as part of the package. If it's a third-party module, adding it to the dependencies.\n\nPrevention could involve adding a check in the startup script to verify that all required modules are present, perhaps by trying to import them and logging a warning if they're missing. Also, using virtual environments and ensuring that the deployment process installs all dependencies correctly.\n\nRisk level for the immediate action: If installing a third-party package, there's a risk of compatibility issues. If modifying the Python path, there's a risk of it not being set correctly in different environments. The confidence level would depend on how certain we are about the cause. Since the error is straightforward (ModuleNotFoundError), the confidence is high that installing the module or fixing the path will resolve it.\n\nSo putting this all together into the required sections.\n</think>\n\n# Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This typically occurs due to:  \n1. Missing installation of the `dexter_brain` package (if it’s a third-party dependency).  \n2. Incorrect project structure or Python path configuration (if `dexter_brain` is a local module).  \n3. Environment misconfiguration (e.g., wrong virtual environment or `PYTHONPATH`).  \n\n**Immediate Action**:  \n1. Verify if `dexter_brain` is a third-party package:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If this fails, check if it’s a local module.  \n2. If local:  \n   - Confirm the directory containing `dexter_brain` is in the Python path.  \n   - Temporarily add the path to `sys.path` in `main.py` before the import:  \n     ```python  \n     import sys  \n     sys.path.append(\"M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\backend\\\\path_to_dexter_brain\")  \n     ```  \n3. Restart the service after changes.  \n\n**Permanent Fix**:  \n1. **Third-party dependency**: Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` and ensure it’s installed in the deployment environment.  \n2. **Local module**:  \n   - Structure the project to include `dexter_brain` as a package (e.g., add an `__init__.py` file).  \n   - Install the project in development mode:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install -e .  \n     ```  \n   - Or update `setup.py` to include the module in `packages`.  \n\n**Prevention**:  \n1. Implement dependency checks during startup:  \n   ```python  \n   try:  \n       import dexter_brain  \n   except ImportError:  \n       raise RuntimeError(\"Missing dependency: dexter_brain\")  \n   ```  \n2. Use CI/CD pipelines to validate dependencies and project structure.  \n3. Monitor for `ModuleNotFoundError` in logs and trigger alerts.  \n\n**Risk Assessment**:  \n- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM (Temporary path modifications may cause environment inconsistencies; improper dependency installation could introduce conflicts).  \n- **Confidence**: HIGH (The error is straightforward, and solutions align with standard Python practices).  \n\n---\n\n# Approach  \n1. **Diagnosis**: Confirm whether `dexter_brain` is a third-party or local module.  \n2. **Immediate Mitigation**: Install the module or adjust the Python path temporarily.  \n3. **Long-Term Resolution**: Integrate the module into the project’s dependency management or structure.  \n4. **Prevention**: Add automated checks and monitoring to catch similar issues early.  \n\n---\n\n# Implementation  \n\n### 1. Check Module Type  \n```bash  \n# Check if dexter_brain is a known package  \npip show dexter_brain  \n```  \nIf not found, assume it’s a local module.  \n\n### 2. Immediate Fix (Local Module)  \nEdit `main.py` to add the module path:  \n```python  \nimport sys  \nimport os  \n\n# Add the directory containing dexter_brain to sys.path  \ndexter_brain_path = os.path.abspath(\"M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\backend\\\\dexter_brain\")  \nif dexter_brain_path not in sys.path:  \n    sys.path.append(dexter_brain_path)  \n\nfrom dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox  \n```  \n\n### 3. Permanent Fix (Local Module)  \n**Option A: Install as Package**  \n1. Add `__init__.py` to the `dexter_brain` directory.  \n2. Create a `setup.py` in the project root:  \n   ```python  \n   from setuptools import setup, find_packages  \n\n   setup(  \n       name=\"gliksbot\",  \n       version=\"0.1\",  \n       packages=find_packages(where=\"M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\backend\"),  \n   )  \n   ```  \n3. Install in development mode:  \n   ```bash  \n   cd M:\\gliksbot  \n   pip install -e .  \n   ```  \n\n**Option B: Update PYTHONPATH**  \nSet the environment variable to include the module directory:  \n```bash  \nset PYTHONPATH=M:\\gliksbot\\backend;%PYTHONPATH%  \n```  \n\n### 4. Prevention  \nAdd a dependency check script (`check_dependencies.py`):  \n```python  \nimport importlib.util  \n\ndef check_module(module_name):  \n    spec = importlib.util.find_spec(module_name)  \n    if spec is None:  \n        raise ImportError(f\"Missing module: {module_name}\")  \n\ncheck_module(\"dexter_brain.sandbox\")  \n```  \nRun this during startup or as a pre-deployment step.  \n\n---\n\n# SKILL_SPEC (Optional)  \nIf the team lacks Python module management expertise, define a skill:  \n```json  \n{  \n  \"skill\": \"Python Dependency Management\",  \n  \"description\": \"Ability to resolve ModuleNotFoundError by installing packages, configuring sys.path, or structuring projects for proper module discovery.\",  \n  \"tools\": [\"pip\", \"setuptools\", \"sys.path\"]  \n}  \n```  \n\nThis approach balances rapid mitigation with robust long-term fixes while minimizing operational disruption."
