  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The traceback points to line 120 in main.py where it's trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox. So the immediate issue is a missing module.\n\nLooking at the system status, there are recent errors and critical ones. The error type is STARTUP_ERROR, which suggests the system can't start up properly because of this missing module. The context isn't available, so maybe the environment isn't set up correctly.\n\nRoot cause analysis: The most likely reason is that the 'dexter_brain' module isn't installed in the Python environment where the application is running. Alternatively, it might be installed in a different environment, or the Python path isn't set correctly so the interpreter can't locate it. Another possibility is that the module is part of the project but not properly included in the deployment or source control.\n\nImmediate action: The user needs to check if the module exists. If it's a third-party package, installing it via pip might help. If it's a local module, ensuring it's in the right directory and that the Python path includes that directory. Maybe the virtual environment isn't activated, so the correct packages aren't available.\n\nPermanent fix: Installing the missing module, ensuring it's part of the dependencies. If it's a custom module, making sure it's included in the project structure and that the import paths are correct. Also, setting up proper environment configurations so that the module is always available when the application runs.\n\nPrevention: Implementing checks during deployment to ensure all required modules are present. Using requirements.txt to list dependencies and automating the installation process. Monitoring for missing modules during startup and alerting before it becomes an issue. Code reviews to catch incorrect imports.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing module could be low if it's a known package, but if the module has dependencies or conflicts with existing packages, that might cause issues. For a permanent fix, ensuring that the module is correctly versioned and compatible with the current environment is important. The risk level here is probably medium because while the fix is straightforward, there's a chance of dependency conflicts.\n\nConfidence in the solution: High, because the error is a common Python issue and the steps to resolve it are well-established. However, without more context on whether 'dexter_brain' is a third-party or internal module, there's a slight uncertainty. But assuming it's a standard package, confidence remains high.\n\nSo putting it all together, the analysis would point to a missing module, immediate steps to install or locate it, permanent fixes involving dependency management, prevention through better deployment checks, and moderate risk.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because Python cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. The module is not installed in the current Python environment  \n2. The module is installed but not in a directory included in PYTHONPATH  \n3. The module is part of the project but misconfigured in the file structure  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' is a third-party package:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n2. If it's a local module:  \n   - Confirm 'dexter_brain' directory exists in the project root  \n   - Ensure it contains an `__init__.py` file  \n   - Add project root to PYTHONPATH:  \n     ```bash  \n     export PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:/M/gliksbot/backend\"  \n     ```  \n3. Check virtual environment activation:  \n   ```bash  \n   which python  # Verify correct interpreter  \n   pip list | grep dexter_brain  # Check installation  \n   ```  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. For third-party packages:  \n   - Add to requirements.txt:  \n     ```  \n     dexter_brain==<version>  \n     ```  \n   - Automate installation in deployment pipeline  \n2. For local modules:  \n   - Structure project as:  \n     ```  \n     M:/gliksbot/  \n       backend/  \n         main.py  \n       dexter_brain/  \n         __init__.py  \n         sandbox.py  \n     ```  \n   - Use relative imports or adjust sys.path in main.py:  \n     ```python  \n     import sys  \n     sys.path.append(sys.path[0] + '/..')  \n     ```  \n\nPrevention:  \n1. Add pre-startup check to validate module existence:  \n   ```python  \n   try:  \n     import dexter_brain  \n   except ImportError:  \n     raise SystemExit(\"Missing dependency: dexter_brain\")  \n   ```  \n2. Implement CI/CD pipeline checks:  \n   - Run `pip check` to validate dependencies  \n   - Use tools like pyproject.toml for dependency management  \n3. Monitor missing module errors with logging:  \n   ```python  \n   logging.error(\"Critical module missing: dexter_brain\", exc_info=True)  \n   ```  \n\nRisk_Level: MEDIUM  \n- Risk of dependency conflicts when installing new packages  \n- Potential path manipulation issues in production environments  \n\nConfidence: HIGH  \n- Solution addresses all common causes of ModuleNotFoundError  \n- Steps are standard Python troubleshooting practices  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
