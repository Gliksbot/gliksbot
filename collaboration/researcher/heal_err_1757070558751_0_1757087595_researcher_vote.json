  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The stack trace points to line 120 in main.py where it's trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox. So the immediate issue is a missing module.\n\nLooking at the system status, there are 121 recent errors and 2 critical ones, with 2 related startup errors. The context isn't available, which might mean there's no additional info from the environment or logs. The error type is STARTUP_ERROR, severity CRITICAL, so this is preventing the system from starting up properly.\n\nFor the root cause analysis: The most likely reason is that the 'dexter_brain' module isn't installed in the Python environment where the application is running. Alternatively, it might be installed in a different environment, or there's a path issue where Python isn't looking in the right directory for the module. Another possibility is that the module was renamed or moved, but the import statement hasn't been updated.\n\nImmediate action would involve checking if the module exists in the environment. The user should verify if 'dexter_brain' is installed. If not, install it using pip or the appropriate package manager. If it's a local module, ensure that the directory containing 'dexter_brain' is in the Python path. Restarting the application after installation might resolve it. If the module is part of a virtual environment, they need to make sure they're using the correct environment.\n\nFor a permanent fix, the solution would involve ensuring that the module is properly installed and available in the environment. If it's a third-party package, adding it to the requirements.txt file so that it's installed consistently across environments. If it's a local module, making sure that the project structure includes it and that the Python path is correctly set up, perhaps by using relative imports or adjusting sys.path in the code.\n\nPrevention could involve setting up monitoring to check for missing modules during deployment, using linters or tools like pyflakes to catch import errors before deployment. Implementing automated testing that runs the startup process to ensure all dependencies are present. Also, using virtual environments and dependency management tools to ensure consistency.\n\nRisk assessment: The immediate action of installing the module might have a low risk if done correctly. However, if the module isn't available or there are version conflicts, it could introduce new issues. The permanent fix of modifying the project structure or dependencies might have a medium risk if not tested properly, but if done right, it's safe.\n\nConfidence in the solution would be high because missing module errors are common and the steps to resolve them are straightforward. However, if the module 'dexter_brain' is a custom or proprietary module, there might be additional steps needed that aren't immediately obvious, which could affect confidence.\n\nSo putting it all together, the root cause is the missing module. Immediate steps are to install it or adjust the path. Permanent fix is ensuring it's included in dependencies. Prevention through better dependency management and testing. Risks are low to medium depending on the environment.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because Python cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to either:  \n1. Missing installation of the module in the current Python environment  \n2. Incorrect Python path configuration preventing module discovery  \n3. Module name typo or case sensitivity mismatch  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify module existence: Run `python -c \"import dexter_brain\"` in the system's Python environment  \n2. If missing: Install via pip (if public package): `pip install dexter-brain` (check package name case)  \n3. If local module: Ensure directory containing 'dexter_brain' is in PYTHONPATH or add it programmatically via `sys.path.append()` in main.py before import  \n4. Restart service: `systemctl restart gliksbot-backend` (or equivalent service manager command)  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. Create/Update requirements.txt with:  \n   ```  \n   dexter-brain==<version>  # If public package  \n   # OR for local modules:  \n   -e /path/to/dexter_brain_root#subdirectory  \n   ```  \n2. Implement dependency check in startup script:  \n   ```python  \n   try:  \n       import dexter_brain  \n   except ImportError:  \n       raise RuntimeError(\"Missing required module: dexter_brain\")  \n   ```  \n3. Standardize environment setup with Docker container or virtualenv to ensure consistent dependencies  \n\nPrevention:  \n1. Add pre-deployment check:  \n   ```bash  \n   python -m pip check | grep -i dexter_brain || { echo \"Missing dependency\"; exit 1; }  \n   ```  \n2. Configure CI/CD pipeline to run:  \n   ```bash  \n   python -c \"import dexter_brain\"  \n   ```  \n3. Implement module existence monitoring in production with alerting  \n\nRisk_Level: LOW  \nConfidence: HIGH  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
