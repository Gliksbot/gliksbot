The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The stack trace points to line 120 in main.py where it's trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox. So the immediate issue is a missing module.\n\nLooking at the error context, there's no context available, which might mean the system didn't capture more details. The system status shows recent and critical errors, but the main problem here is the missing module.\n\nRoot cause analysis: The most likely reasons are that the dexter_brain module isn't installed, not in the Python path, or there's a typo in the import statement. Since the error is during startup, it's probably a dependency issue. Maybe the module wasn't installed in the environment where the application is running.\n\nImmediate action: Check if the module exists in the environment. If not, install it. But how? The user might need to install it via pip or ensure it's in the right directory. Also, checking the Python path to make sure the module's location is included.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure that the module is properly installed and included in the project's dependencies. Maybe adding it to requirements.txt or setting up a virtual environment that includes it. Also, checking the import statement for any typos.\n\nPrevention: Implement dependency checks during deployment, maybe using a requirements file and a script to verify all dependencies are installed. Also, monitoring for missing modules during startup could help catch this earlier.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a new module might be medium if it's not well-tested, but since it's part of the system, it's probably necessary. The confidence in this solution is high because it's a common issue with straightforward fixes.\n\nNow, considering the special considerations: The solution shouldn't disrupt operations. If the system is in a production environment, installing the module might require a restart, which could be a problem. But since it's a startup error, the system might not be running anyway. So the immediate action would be to install the module and restart the service.\n\nWait, but how do we know if the module is supposed to be there? The error is from the system source, so maybe dexter_brain is a custom module. If that's the case, the user might need to ensure that the module is present in the project directory or installed as a package. Checking the project structure for the dexter_brain directory would be important.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the module was moved or renamed, leading to the import failure. Checking the codebase for any recent changes that might have affected the module's location or name.\n\nBut given the information, the most probable cause is a missing dependency. So the steps would be to install the module, check the import path, and ensure it's included in the environment.\n\nFor the implementation, the user might need to run pip install dexter_brain, but if it's a private module, they might need to install it from a specific source or add it to the Python path. Alternatively, if the module is part of the project, ensuring that the directory containing dexter_brain is in the same directory as main.py or adding it to sys.path.\n\nIn the response, the immediate action should be concrete. For example, check if the module exists, install it if necessary, and restart the service. The permanent fix would involve updating dependencies and ensuring the environment is correctly set up. Prevention could include adding checks in the deployment pipeline.\n\nI need to structure this into the required sections: Analysis, Approach, Implementation. Also, check if any new skills are needed. Since this is a standard Python module issue, probably no new skills required beyond Python troubleshooting.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This typically occurs due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., not in the project directory or a virtual environment).  \n3. **Typo/Misnaming**: A typo in the import statement or module name.  \n\nGiven the context, the most likely cause is **missing installation** or **incorrect environment configuration**.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Immediate Action**:  \n   - Verify the existence of the `dexter_brain` module in the environment.  \n   - Install the module if missing (via `pip` or project-specific setup).  \n   - Restart the service to apply changes.  \n\n2. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Ensure `dexter_brain` is included in the project’s dependency list (e.g., `requirements.txt`).  \n   - Validate the module’s installation path and Python environment alignment.  \n   - Implement automated dependency checks during deployment.  \n\n3. **Prevention**:  \n   - Add pre-startup dependency validation scripts.  \n   - Monitor for missing modules using logging or health checks.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### Immediate_Action  \n1. **Check Module Installation**:  \n   Run in the terminal (within the project’s environment):  \n   ```bash  \n   python -c \"import dexter_brain; print(dexter_brain.__file__)\"  \n   ```  \n   If this fails, proceed to install.  \n\n2. **Install the Module**:  \n   - If `dexter_brain` is a public package:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install dexter_brain  \n     ```  \n   - If it’s a local/custom module:  \n     Ensure the directory containing `dexter_brain/__init__.py` is in the project root or add it to `PYTHONPATH`:  \n     ```bash  \n     export PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/dexter_brain\"  \n     ```  \n\n3. **Restart the Service**:  \n   ```bash  \n   systemctl restart gliksbot-backend  \n   # Or use the appropriate service manager for your environment  \n   ```  \n\n---\n\n#### Permanent_Fix  \n1. **Update Dependencies**:  \n   Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt`:  \n   ```txt  \n   dexter_brain==<version>  \n   ```  \n   Or, if it’s a local module, ensure it’s included in the project repository and referenced correctly in `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`.  \n\n2. **Environment Validation**:  \n   Create a startup script to verify dependencies:  \n   ```python  \n   # validate_dependencies.py  \n   try:  \n       import dexter_brain  \n   except ImportError:  \n       raise RuntimeError(\"Missing dependency: dexter_brain\")  \n   ```  \n   Run this script before starting the main application.  \n\n---\n\n#### Prevention  \n1. **Automated Checks**:  \n   Integrate dependency validation into CI/CD pipelines:  \n   ```bash  \n   # Example GitHub Actions step  \n   - name: Check dependencies  \n     run: python validate_dependencies.py  \n   ```  \n\n2. **Monitoring**:  \n   Add logging for missing modules in `main.py`:  \n   ```python  \n   try:  \n       from dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox  \n   except ImportError as e:  \n       logger.critical(f\"Missing module: {e}\")  \n       raise  \n   ```  \n\n---\n\n#### Risk_Level: **LOW**  \n- **Rationale**: Installing a missing module is a low-risk action, especially if the module is part of the project’s intended dependencies.  \n\n#### Confidence: **HIGH**  \n- **Rationale**: The solution directly addresses the error’s root cause and aligns with standard Python troubleshooting practices.  \n\n--- \n\n### SKILL_SPEC (Optional)  \nIf the team lacks Python environment management skills, provide training on:  \n- Virtual environments (`venv`, `conda`)  \n- Dependency management (`pip`, `requirements.txt`)  \n- Python path configuration  \n\nNo new code required beyond the steps above."
