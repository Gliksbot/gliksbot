  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a ModuleNotFoundError for 'dexter_brain' when starting up the system. The error is a startup error, critical severity. The stack trace shows that the import in main.py line 120 is failing.\n\nFirst, root cause. The error says 'No module named dexter_brain', which usually means that the Python environment doesn't have that package installed. Alternatively, maybe the module isn't in the right directory, or there's a typo in the import. But given the context, probably an installation issue.\n\nImmediate action: They need to install the missing module. But where is 'dexter_brain' coming from? If it's a third-party package, maybe pip install dexter_brain. But if it's a local module, the directory structure might be wrong. The path in the error is M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\main.py, so maybe the 'dexter_brain' should be in the same directory or a parent directory. Alternatively, the Python path might not include the location where dexter_brain is installed.\n\nWait, the error message says \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\", so Python can't find it. So possible reasons: not installed, not in the right place, or the environment isn't set up correctly.\n\nLooking at the system status, there are 193 recent errors and 2 critical ones. Maybe other issues are related, but focusing on this one.\n\nImmediate action steps: Check if dexter_brain is installed. If not, install it. If it's a local package, ensure it's in the Python path. Maybe the virtual environment isn't activated, or the installation is in a different environment.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure that the module is properly installed in the environment, and that the environment is correctly configured. If it's a dependency, add it to requirements.txt. If it's a local module, make sure the directory structure is correct and that the module is in a location that Python can find.\n\nPrevention: Set up monitoring to check for missing modules during deployment, maybe a pre-start check. Also, ensure that all dependencies are listed in the requirements and that the deployment process installs them correctly. Maybe use a virtual environment and a requirements file to standardize the setup.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a new package could be medium if it's a third-party package with possible dependencies or conflicts. If it's a local module, the risk is lower. The immediate action of installing the package might not disrupt operations if done correctly, but if the package has issues, it could cause more problems.\n\nConfidence: High, because the error is straightforward. The solution would be to install the missing module or adjust the Python path.\n\nWait, but the user might not have the dexter_brain package available. If it's a custom module, maybe the code isn't in the right place. So checking the file system for the presence of dexter_brain directory with __init__.py would be important. If it's missing, then the code needs to be added there.\n\nSo, in the immediate action, steps could include:\n\n1. Check if 'dexter_brain' is present in the project directory or installed as a package.\n2. If it's a local module, ensure that the directory is in the Python path. Maybe the code is in a different location than expected.\n3. If it's a package, install it using pip.\n4. If using a virtual environment, ensure that the correct environment is activated and that the package is installed there.\n\nFor the permanent fix, adding the dependency to the requirements.txt or setup.py so that it's installed automatically during deployment. Also, ensuring that the directory structure is correct and that the module is in a location that Python can import from.\n\nPrevention could involve adding a check in the deployment script to verify that all required modules are present before starting the application. Also, using a linter or import checker during development to catch missing imports.\n\nRisk level for the solution: If installing a package, medium risk if the package has compatibility issues. If it's a local module, low risk once the directory is fixed.\n\nConfidence in the solution: High, assuming that the module exists somewhere and just needs to be installed or the path adjusted.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because the Python interpreter cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. The module is not installed in the current Python environment  \n2. The module's directory is not in the Python path  \n3. The module file/directory is missing or misnamed  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' is a local module or external package  \n2. If local: Check if `dexter_brain/` directory exists in `M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\` or parent directories. If missing, restore from version control or backup  \n3. If external: Run `pip install dexter-brain` (or appropriate package name) in the active virtual environment  \n4. If path issue: Add directory containing `dexter_brain` to PYTHONPATH environment variable  \n5. Retry startup  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. If local module:  \n   - Ensure `dexter_brain` directory contains `__init__.py`  \n   - Add `..` to `PYTHONPATH` in runtime environment or restructure project to include module in standard import path  \n2. If external package:  \n   - Add `dexter-brain` to `requirements.txt`  \n   - Implement automated dependency installation in deployment pipeline  \n3. Create setup.py/config.py to handle module discovery  \n\nPrevention:  \n1. Add pre-startup check script to validate critical module availability  \n2. Implement dependency locking (e.g., pip freeze > requirements.txt)  \n3. Use linters (pylint, flake8) to detect import errors during development  \n4. Monitor import errors in CI/CD pipeline  \n\nRisk_Level: MEDIUM  \n- Risk of installing unknown packages  \n- Potential path modifications affecting other components  \n\nConfidence: HIGH  \n- Solution addresses all common causes of ModuleNotFoundError  \n- Steps are standard Python troubleshooting procedures  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
