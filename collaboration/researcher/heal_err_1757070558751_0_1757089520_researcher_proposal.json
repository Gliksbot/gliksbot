  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to parse through that. The error is a STARTUP_ERROR with the message \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". The stack trace points to main.py trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nFirst, the root cause. The error is a ModuleNotFoundError, which usually means the module isn't installed or not in the Python path. Since it's a startup error, the system can't initialize because it's missing this module. The context says no context available, so maybe the environment isn't set up correctly.\n\nImmediate action: They need to check if the module exists in the environment. Maybe the virtual environment isn't activated, or the module wasn't installed. They should try installing it via pip or check the import path. If it's a local module, maybe the directory structure is wrong.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure the module is properly installed and available in the Python environment. If it's a third-party package, add it to requirements.txt. If it's a local module, make sure it's in the right directory and the Python path includes it. Maybe set up a virtual environment and install dependencies.\n\nPrevention: Add checks during deployment to verify all dependencies are installed. Use linters or tools to check for missing imports. Implement monitoring for startup errors and have alerts. Maybe use a CI/CD pipeline that runs tests and checks dependencies before deployment.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a new module could be medium if it's not tested, but if it's a known dependency, it's lower. The immediate action of installing might have a low risk if done in a controlled environment.\n\nWait, but the error is in the system source, so maybe the dexter_brain module is part of the internal codebase. If that's the case, the problem could be that the module isn't in the correct directory, or the Python path isn't set up to include it. So the solution might involve checking the file structure, ensuring that dexter_brain is in the same directory as main.py or in a location that's part of the sys.path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the module was renamed or moved, so the import statement is incorrect. Checking the code for correct import paths would be necessary.\n\nSo, putting this all together. The analysis would be that the module isn't found because it's not installed or not in the right location. Immediate action is to check the environment and install or adjust paths. Permanent fix is to ensure dependencies are properly managed. Prevention through better dependency management and testing.\n\nI need to structure this into the required sections. Also, check if any new skills are needed. The user mentioned if a new skill is required, provide SKILL_SPEC and code. But in this case, it's more about standard Python troubleshooting, so maybe no new skill needed. Just steps to resolve the import error.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect directory structure or missing `__init__.py`).  \n3. **Virtual Environment Issue**: The code is running outside the intended virtual environment where dependencies are installed.  \n\n**Context**:  \n- The error occurs during startup (`startup_event` in `main.py`), suggesting a dependency missing at runtime.  \n- No context available implies potential gaps in deployment or environment setup documentation.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Immediate Action**:  \n   - Verify the presence of `dexter_brain` in the environment.  \n   - Check if the module is installed or available in the project directory.  \n   - Validate Python path configurations.  \n\n2. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Ensure `dexter_brain` is installed (via `pip` if third-party or added to the project if internal).  \n   - Confirm the module’s directory is included in `sys.path`.  \n   - Standardize environment setup (e.g., `requirements.txt`, virtual environment).  \n\n3. **Prevention**:  \n   - Implement dependency checks during deployment.  \n   - Use static analysis tools (e.g., `pylint`, `mypy`) to detect missing imports.  \n   - Monitor startup errors and automate alerts.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### **Immediate Action**  \n1. **Check Module Installation**:  \n   Run in the project’s environment:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip show dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If not found, install it (if third-party) or locate the module.  \n\n2. **Verify File Structure**:  \n   Ensure `dexter_brain` is a directory in the project root (e.g., `M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\dexter_brain`) with an `__init__.py` file.  \n\n3. **Check Python Path**:  \n   Temporarily add the directory to `sys.path` in `main.py` (before the import):  \n   ```python  \n   import sys  \n   sys.path.append(\"M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\backend\")  \n   ```  \n\n#### **Permanent Fix**  \n1. **Install Dependency**:  \n   If `dexter_brain` is a third-party package:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If internal, ensure it’s included in the project repository and deployed correctly.  \n\n2. **Update `requirements.txt`**:  \n   Add the dependency for future deployments:  \n   ```txt  \n   dexter_brain==<version>  \n   ```  \n\n3. **Environment Standardization**:  \n   Use a virtual environment and automate setup:  \n   ```bash  \n   python -m venv venv  \n   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate  \n   pip install -r requirements.txt  \n   ```  \n\n#### **Prevention**  \n1. **Add Pre-Startup Checks**:  \n   Create a script to validate dependencies before launching:  \n   ```python  \n   # check_dependencies.py  \n   try:  \n       import dexter_brain  \n   except ImportError:  \n       raise RuntimeError(\"Missing dependency: dexter_brain\")  \n   ```  \n\n2. **CI/CD Integration**:  \n   Add a pipeline step to run `check_dependencies.py` during deployment.  \n\n3. **Monitoring**:  \n   Log and alert on `STARTUP_ERROR` occurrences using tools like Prometheus or Sentry.  \n\n---\n\n### Risk Assessment  \n- **Risk Level**: **LOW** (Steps are non-invasive and reversible.)  \n- **Confidence**: **HIGH** (Standard Python troubleshooting with clear resolution paths.)  \n\n--- \n\n### SKILL_SPEC (If Required)  \nNot applicable; solution relies on standard Python/DevOps practices.  \n\n--- \n\n**Vote**: This approach balances speed (immediate path fix) and sustainability (environment standardization) while minimizing disruption."
