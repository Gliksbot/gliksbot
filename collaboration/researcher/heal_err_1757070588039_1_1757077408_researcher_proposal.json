  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That's a Python error, right? When Python can't find a module, it's usually an import issue. The traceback shows it's happening in main.py line 120 when trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox. So the problem is that the 'dexter_brain' module isn't available in the environment where the code is running.\n\nLooking at the error details: it's a STARTUP_ERROR of CRITICAL severity. The system is trying to start up but can't because it's missing this module. The context isn't available, so maybe there's no additional info from the system. The stack trace confirms the import error.\n\nNow, the mission is to diagnose and provide healing solutions. The analysis required has five parts: root cause, immediate action, permanent fix, prevention, and risk assessment.\n\nRoot cause: The module 'dexter_brain' isn't installed or not in the Python path. Maybe it's a missing dependency, or the environment isn't set up correctly. Could be that the package wasn't installed, or the code is in a different directory not included in PYTHONPATH.\n\nImmediate action: They need to get the system running. So possible steps are installing the missing module, checking the environment, or modifying the Python path. But how? If 'dexter_brain' is a third-party package, pip install. If it's a local module, maybe the directory structure is wrong. Alternatively, check if it's a typo in the import statement.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure the module is properly installed and available in the environment. If it's a local package, maybe adding it to the project's setup.py or requirements.txt. Or setting up the environment correctly so that the module's path is included.\n\nPrevention: Implement checks during deployment to ensure all dependencies are installed. Use virtual environments, CI/CD pipelines that test imports, or monitoring to check for missing modules before startup.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a new package could be medium if it's not tested. Modifying environment variables might have low risk if done correctly. But if the module is not supposed to be there, maybe there's a deeper issue.\n\nWait, but the error is in the backend's main.py. So 'dexter_brain' is likely a custom module part of the project. So maybe the project structure is such that the dexter_brain directory isn't in the same directory as main.py, or not included in the package. So the immediate fix could be to check the directory structure, maybe add the parent directory to PYTHONPATH. Alternatively, if it's a package that needs to be installed, perhaps it's not in the requirements.txt.\n\nSo possible steps for immediate action: Check if dexter_brain exists in the project directory. If it's there, check if it's in the right location. If not, maybe the code is missing. If it's a package, install it. If it's a local module, adjust the import or the environment variables.\n\nFor permanent fix: Ensure that the module is included in the project's dependencies, either by installing it or by proper directory structure. Maybe adding the directory to sys.path in the code, but that's a workaround. Better to structure the project so that the module is importable.\n\nPrevention: Use a virtual environment with all dependencies listed in requirements.txt. Run tests that check for missing imports. Use linters or tools like pyflakes to catch import errors before deployment.\n\nRisk level: The immediate action might involve modifying environment variables or installing packages, which could have medium risk if not tested. Permanent fixes like adjusting the project structure or dependencies would have lower risk once verified.\n\nConfidence: High, because the error is a common Python import issue, and the solutions are standard practices.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRoot cause: Missing 'dexter_brain' module in the Python environment.\n\nImmediate action: Check if the module exists locally, install if it's a package, or adjust PYTHONPATH to include the directory containing dexter_brain.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure the module is properly installed or the project structure includes it in the path. Update requirements.txt or setup.py as needed.\n\nPrevention: Implement dependency checks in CI/CD, use virtual environments, and monitor for import errors.\n\nRisk level: Medium for immediate actions, low for permanent fixes.\n\nConfidence: High.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in a directory included in the `PYTHONPATH` or project structure.  \n3. **Project Structure Issue**: The module might be part of the project but mislocated (e.g., not in the same directory as `main.py` or not properly packaged).  \n\n**Immediate Action**:  \n1. Verify if `dexter_brain` is a local module or a third-party package.  \n2. If local, confirm its directory location and ensure it is accessible (e.g., in the same directory as `main.py` or added to `sys.path`).  \n3. If third-party, install it via `pip install dexter_brain` (if available).  \n4. Temporarily adjust `PYTHONPATH` to include the module’s directory if the issue is urgent.  \n\n**Permanent Fix**:  \n1. **For Local Modules**:  \n   - Ensure `dexter_brain` is in the project root directory or a subdirectory listed in `sys.path`.  \n   - Add an `__init__.py` file to the module directory (if missing) to make it a package.  \n   - Update the project’s `setup.py` or `requirements.txt` to include dependencies.  \n2. **For Third-Party Packages**:  \n   - Install the package in the virtual environment.  \n   - Pin the version in `requirements.txt` to avoid version mismatches.  \n\n**Prevention**:  \n1. Use a **virtual environment** with a locked `requirements.txt` to ensure consistent dependencies.  \n2. Implement **CI/CD pipeline checks** for missing imports (e.g., `pylint`, `flake8`, or custom scripts).  \n3. Monitor startup logs for `ModuleNotFoundError` and alert on failures.  \n\n**Risk Assessment**:  \n- **Immediate Action Risk**: Medium (modifying `PYTHONPATH` or installing packages without testing could introduce conflicts).  \n- **Permanent Fix Risk**: Low (properly structured code and dependency management are standard practices).  \n- **Confidence**: High (common Python import issue with well-established solutions).  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Diagnose Module Source**:  \n   - Check if `dexter_brain` is a local module (e.g., exists in the project repository) or a third-party package.  \n   - If local, validate its location and structure.  \n\n2. **Implement Hotfix**:  \n   - Temporarily add the module’s directory to `PYTHONPATH` to resolve the immediate error.  \n\n3. **Long-Term Resolution**:  \n   - Integrate the module into the project’s dependency management system (e.g., `setup.py` or `requirements.txt`).  \n\n4. **Prevent Recurrence**:  \n   - Automate dependency checks and environment validation.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### 1. **Immediate Action**  \n```bash  \n# Step 1: Check if dexter_brain is a local directory  \nls M:\\gliksbot\\backend/ | grep \"dexter_brain\"  \n\n# If missing, clone or restore the module  \ngit clone [repository-url] M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\dexter_brain  \n\n# Step 2: Temporarily add the module directory to PYTHONPATH  \nset PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;M:\\gliksbot\\backend  \npython M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\main.py  \n```  \n\n#### 2. **Permanent Fix**  \n**If `dexter_brain` is a local module**:  \n```python  \n# Ensure the module is in the project root or a subdirectory  \n# Example directory structure:  \n# M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\  \n#   ├── main.py  \n#   └── dexter_brain/  \n#       ├── __init__.py  \n#       └── sandbox.py  \n\n# In main.py, ensure imports are relative or absolute  \nfrom dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox  \n```  \n\n**If `dexter_brain` is a third-party package**:  \n```bash  \npip install dexter_brain  \necho \"dexter_brain==[version]\" >> requirements.txt  \n```  \n\n#### 3. **Prevention**  \n**Add to CI/CD Pipeline**:  \n```bash  \n# Example step in GitHub Actions/GitLab CI  \n- name: Check for missing imports  \n  run: |  \n    python -m py_compile $(find . -name \"*.py\")  \n    python -c \"import dexter_brain\"  \n```  \n\n**Monitor Logs**:  \n```bash  \n# Alert if \"ModuleNotFoundError\" appears in logs  \ngrep \"ModuleNotFoundError\" /var/log/system.log | alert_team  \n```  \n\n---\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (Optional)  \n**Skill**: Python Module Path Debugger  \n**Code**:  \n```python  \n# Add to main.py for debugging  \nimport sys  \nprint(\"Python Path:\", sys.path)  \n# Check if dexter_brain directory is in sys.path  \nif \"M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\backend\" not in sys.path:  \n    sys.path.append(\"M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\backend\")  \n```  \n\nThis ensures the module path is explicitly checked and adjusted at runtime."
