  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The stack trace points to line 120 in main.py where it's trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox. So the immediate issue is a missing module.\n\nLooking at the error type, it's a STARTUP_ERROR, which suggests the system can't start because of this missing dependency. The source is the system itself, so maybe the environment isn't set up correctly. The context isn't available, which might mean there's no additional info from the user, so I have to rely on the given data.\n\nFor the root cause, possible reasons are: the module isn't installed, it's not in the Python path, there's a typo in the name, or the environment isn't activated. Since the error is during startup, it's likely that the module isn't installed in the current environment.\n\nImmediate actions would involve checking if the module exists, installing it if necessary, and ensuring the environment is correct. The user might need to install the package via pip, or if it's a local module, ensure it's in the right directory and included in the Python path.\n\nPermanent fix could involve adding the module to the project's dependencies, ensuring it's included in the requirements.txt or setup.py. Also, checking the environment setup steps to make sure that installing dependencies is part of the process.\n\nPrevention would involve setting up monitoring for missing modules during startup, maybe adding checks in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure all dependencies are installed. Also, using virtual environments to isolate dependencies and avoid conflicts.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing module is low if it's a known package. However, if 'dexter_brain' is a custom module, there might be compatibility issues. Need to confirm where this module comes from.\n\nWait, the error is about 'dexter_brain' which isn't a standard Python module. So it's probably a custom or internal package. That changes things. The user might have a local module named dexter_brain that's not in the right location. So the solution would involve checking the project structure, ensuring that the module is present in the Python path, maybe adding the directory to sys.path in the code, or installing it as a package.\n\nAlternatively, if it's a third-party package, maybe it's not available on PyPI, so the user needs to install it from a specific source. But since the error is during startup, the system might be expecting this module to be present.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Check if dexter_brain is a local module. If yes, ensure it's in the correct directory and the Python path includes that directory.\n\n2. If it's a package, install it using pip, possibly from a private repository or a specific path.\n\n3. Update the requirements to include this dependency.\n\nFor immediate action, the user should check the file structure, look for the dexter_brain directory, and if missing, restore it from version control or another source. If it's supposed to be installed, run pip install.\n\nPermanent fix would involve documenting the dependency and ensuring it's included in the setup process.\n\nPrevention could include adding a check during startup to verify all required modules are present, and setting up automated testing to catch missing dependencies.\n\nRisk level: Medium, because installing or modifying the environment could introduce other issues, but necessary to fix the error.\n\nConfidence: High, assuming the module is supposed to be present and the issue is an installation or path problem.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect directory structure or missing `__init__.py`).  \n3. **Environment Misconfiguration**: The wrong Python environment is active (e.g., virtual environment not activated).  \n\n**Immediate Action**:  \n1. Verify if `dexter_brain` is a local module or a third-party package.  \n2. Check the project directory structure for a `dexter_brain` folder.  \n3. Ensure the Python path includes the directory containing `dexter_brain`.  \n\n**Permanent Fix**:  \n1. If `dexter_brain` is a local module:  \n   - Ensure it is included in the project repository and placed in the correct directory (e.g., `backend/dexter_brain`).  \n   - Add the directory to the Python path in `main.py` (if not already there).  \n2. If `dexter_brain` is a third-party package:  \n   - Install it via `pip install dexter_brain` (or from a private repository if applicable).  \n   - Add it to `requirements.txt` for future deployments.  \n\n**Prevention**:  \n1. Implement dependency checks during startup (e.g., verify required modules exist before proceeding).  \n2. Use a `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile` to standardize environment setup.  \n3. Add CI/CD pipeline checks to validate module availability.  \n\n**Risk Assessment**:  \n- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM (Modifying paths or installing packages could introduce conflicts, but the error is critical and requires resolution).  \n- **Confidence**: HIGH (The solution addresses common causes of `ModuleNotFoundError`).  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Diagnose Module Source**: Determine if `dexter_brain` is local or external.  \n2. **Validate Environment**: Confirm Python environment and path configurations.  \n3. **Implement Fixes**: Install or re-link the module, update dependencies, and adjust paths if needed.  \n4. **Prevent Recurrence**: Add automated checks and documentation for dependencies.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### 1. **Immediate Action**  \n```bash  \n# Step 1: Check for local module  \nls M:\\gliksbot\\backend/ | grep \"dexter_brain\"  \n\n# If missing, restore from version control or reinstall  \ngit restore M:\\gliksbot\\backend/dexter_brain  \n\n# Step 2: Verify Python path  \npython -c \"import sys; print(sys.path)\"  \n\n# Step 3: Add directory to path (if needed)  \n# Add to main.py before import:  \n# import sys  \n# sys.path.append(\"M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\backend\")  \n\n# Step 4: Install if third-party  \npip install dexter_brain  \n```  \n\n#### 2. **Permanent Fix**  \n**For Local Module**:  \n- Ensure `dexter_brain` is in the project root and includes an `__init__.py` file.  \n- Update `main.py` to reference the module correctly.  \n\n**For Third-Party Package**:  \n- Add to `requirements.txt`:  \n  ```  \n  dexter_brain==<version>  \n  ```  \n- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the deployment environment.  \n\n#### 3. **Prevention**  \n**Code Change**: Add a startup check in `main.py`:  \n```python  \ntry:  \n    import dexter_brain  \nexcept ImportError:  \n    raise RuntimeError(\"Missing dependency: dexter_brain. Install via 'pip install dexter_brain' or restore the module.\")  \n```  \n\n**CI/CD Check**:  \n```bash  \n# In CI pipeline  \npython -c \"import dexter_brain\" || exit 1  \n```  \n\n---\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (If New Skill Required)  \n**Skill**: Python Module Path Debugging  \n**Code**:  \n```python  \n# module_debug.py  \nimport sys  \nimport os  \n\ndef check_module(module_name):  \n    try:  \n        __import__(module_name)  \n        print(f\"[OK] Module {module_name} found.\")  \n    except ImportError:  \n        print(f\"[ERROR] Module {module_name} not found.\")  \n        print(\"Python Path:\", sys.path)  \n        print(\"Current Working Directory:\", os.getcwd())  \n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":  \n    check_module(\"dexter_brain\")  \n```  \nRun with: `python module_debug.py` to diagnose path issues.  \n\n--- \n\n**Vote**: This solution balances rapid resolution (immediate steps) with long-term stability (dependency management and checks)."
