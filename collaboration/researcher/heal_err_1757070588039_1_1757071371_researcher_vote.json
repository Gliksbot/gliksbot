  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a ModuleNotFoundError for 'dexter_brain' when starting up their system. The error is a STARTUP_ERROR with CRITICAL severity, so it's preventing the system from initializing properly.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out why Python can't find the 'dexter_brain' module. Common reasons for this are that the module isn't installed, there's a typo in the name, or the Python path isn't set correctly. Since the error is happening during startup, it's likely that the module is part of the application's dependencies but isn't available in the current environment.\n\nLooking at the stack trace, the error occurs in main.py when trying to import from 'dexter_brain.sandbox'. The file path is M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\main.py, so the project is located there. The 'dexter_brain' module might be a local package that's supposed to be in the same project directory or a separate package that needs to be installed.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if 'dexter_brain' is present in the project directory. If it's a local module, maybe the directory structure has changed, or the module wasn't included in the deployment. Alternatively, if it's a third-party package, it might not be installed in the current Python environment.\n\nFor a permanent fix, if 'dexter_brain' is a local package, adding it to the Python path or installing it in development mode could help. If it's a third-party package, installing it via pip would be necessary. Also, checking the requirements.txt file to ensure all dependencies are listed and installed.\n\nPrevention would involve setting up proper dependency management, ensuring that all required packages are included in the environment, and possibly using virtual environments to isolate dependencies. Adding checks during the build or deployment process to verify that all modules are present could also prevent this error.\n\nRisk assessment for the solutions: If installing a missing package, there's a risk of version conflicts, but if it's a local package, the risk is lower. Modifying the Python path might have implications if the environment changes, so that's a medium risk. Ensuring that the package is correctly installed and version-controlled would mitigate these risks.\n\nSo, putting this together, the root cause is a missing module. Immediate action would be to check the presence of 'dexter_brain' and install or link it. Permanent fix involves ensuring the module is part of the project's dependencies. Prevention through dependency management and environment checks. Risk level is medium because incorrect installation could lead to other issues, but the solution is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because Python cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. The module is missing from the project environment  \n2. The module's directory is not in the Python path  \n3. There's a version mismatch or installation failure  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' exists in the project directory (check M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\ or parent directories)  \n2. If missing, restore from version control or reinstall the package using:  \n   `pip install dexter_brain` (if third-party)  \n   OR  \n   `pip install -e .` (if local development package)  \n3. If present but not recognized, add directory to PYTHONPATH:  \n   `set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;M:\\gliksbot` (Windows)  \n   OR  \n   `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/gliksbot` (Linux/Mac)  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. Ensure 'dexter_brain' is listed in requirements.txt:  \n   `echo \"dexter_brain==<version>\" >> requirements.txt`  \n2. Implement proper dependency management:  \n   - Use virtual environments (venv)  \n   - Freeze dependencies: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`  \n   - For local packages, use development installs:  \n     `pip install -e .` in project root  \n\nPrevention:  \n1. Add pre-startup validation script to check critical modules exist  \n2. Implement CI/CD pipeline checks for dependency integrity  \n3. Use .gitignore-safe environment configuration files (e.g., .env)  \n4. Monitor missing module errors in logging system  \n\nRisk_Level: MEDIUM  \n- Risk of version conflicts when installing packages  \n- PYTHONPATH changes may affect other projects if not isolated  \n\nConfidence: HIGH  \n- Solution addresses all common causes of ModuleNotFoundError  \n- Steps are standard Python dependency management practices  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
