  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a ModuleNotFoundError for 'dexter_brain' when starting up their system. The error is a startup error, critical severity, and it's happened twice. The stack trace points to line 120 in main.py trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nFirst, root cause. The error says the module isn't found. That usually means the module isn't installed, or there's an issue with the Python path. Since it's a startup error, maybe the environment where the system is running doesn't have the dexter_brain package installed. Alternatively, the package might be installed but not in the right directory, or there's a typo in the import statement. But the error message is pretty clear: 'No module named 'dexter_brain'', so the module isn't present in the Python environment.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if the package is installed. If it's a third-party package, maybe they need to install it using pip. If it's a local package, maybe the directory isn't in the PYTHONPATH. They could try installing it or adding the path. But since the error is happening during startup, maybe the virtual environment isn't activated, or the package was installed in a different environment.\n\nPermanent fix would involve ensuring that the package is properly installed in the correct environment. If it's a dependency, adding it to the requirements.txt or setup.py so that it's installed automatically. If it's a local module, making sure the directory structure is correct and the package is in a location that Python can find. Maybe creating a symlink or adjusting the sys.path in the code.\n\nPrevention would involve setting up proper dependency management, using virtual environments, and maybe adding checks during the startup process to verify that all required modules are present. Also, monitoring for missing modules and having alerts set up for startup errors.\n\nRisks: If they install the package, there might be version conflicts with other dependencies. If they modify the Python path, it could cause issues if the path is not correctly set in all environments. The risk level here is probably medium because installing a missing package is straightforward but could have unintended consequences if there are version mismatches.\n\nConfidence: High, because the error is a common Python issue and the solution is usually straightforward. But depends on the actual setup of the system.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRoot cause: The dexter_brain module is not installed or not in the Python path.\n\nImmediate action: Install the package via pip if it's third-party, or add the directory to PYTHONPATH. Check the environment.\n\nPermanent fix: Add the package to dependencies, ensure proper installation in the environment, structure the project so that the module is in the right location.\n\nPrevention: Use requirements.txt, virtualenv, and pre-startup checks.\n\nRisk level: Medium.\n\nConfidence: High.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because the Python interpreter cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. The module is not installed in the current Python environment  \n2. The module's directory is not in the Python path  \n3. There is a typo/mismatch in the module name  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' is a third-party package:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n2. If it's a local module:  \n   - Confirm the directory containing 'dexter_brain/__init__.py' exists  \n   - Add the parent directory to PYTHONPATH:  \n     ```bash  \n     export PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/parent/directory\"  \n     ```  \n3. Check for typos in import statements in main.py  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. If third-party: Add to requirements.txt:  \n   ```  \n   dexter_brain==<version>  \n   ```  \n   Ensure virtual environment is activated during deployment  \n2. If local:  \n   - Structure project as a package with setup.py  \n   - Install locally:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install -e .  \n     ```  \n   - Or move 'dexter_brain' directory to the same level as main.py  \n\nPrevention:  \n1. Implement dependency checks in startup script:  \n   ```python  \n   try:  \n       import dexter_brain  \n   except ImportError:  \n       raise RuntimeError(\"Missing dependency: dexter_brain\")  \n   ```  \n2. Use CI/CD pipeline to validate environment setup  \n3. Monitor Python path configuration in production  \n\nRisk_Level: MEDIUM (Potential version conflicts if installing third-party packages)  \nConfidence: HIGH (Standard Python module resolution issue with clear solutions)  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
