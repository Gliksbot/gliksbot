The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The stack trace shows the error occurs in main.py line 120 when importing from dexter_brain.sandbox. So the immediate issue is a missing module.\n\nLooking at the error details, it's a startup error, critical severity. The system tried once, so maybe it's the first attempt. The context isn't available, which might mean there's no additional info from the system logs. The system status shows recent and critical errors, so this might be part of a larger issue, but focusing on this specific error first.\n\nRoot cause analysis: The most common reason for a ModuleNotFoundError is that the module isn't installed, or it's not in the Python path. Since the error is in the startup, maybe the environment isn't set up correctly. The module 'dexter_brain' might be a custom module or a third-party one. If it's a custom module, perhaps the directory structure changed, or the module isn't in the right place. If it's a package, maybe it wasn't installed via pip or another package manager.\n\nImmediate action: Check if the module exists in the environment. The user might need to verify the installation. If it's a local module, ensure that the directory containing dexter_brain is in the Python path. Alternatively, if it's a package, install it using pip. Since the error is during startup, restarting the service after fixing the module path or installation should help.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure that the module is properly installed or included in the project structure. If it's a dependency, add it to the requirements.txt. If it's a local module, make sure the project structure is correct and that the Python path includes the necessary directories. Using virtual environments could help manage dependencies better.\n\nPrevention: Implement checks during deployment to ensure all dependencies are installed. Use linters or tools that check for missing imports before deployment. Monitoring for ModuleNotFoundError in logs can catch these issues early. Also, having a proper CI/CD pipeline that runs tests and checks dependencies can prevent such errors from reaching production.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing module is generally low if the module is trusted. However, if the module has dependencies or requires specific versions, there might be compatibility issues. For immediate action, checking the module's presence is safe. The permanent fix of adding it to dependencies is also low risk if done correctly.\n\nNow, considering the system's source is 'system', maybe it's a backend service that relies on this module. The error occurred during startup, so the service isn't running. The user needs to get it running again quickly.\n\nFor the implementation steps, the immediate action would involve checking the environment, installing the module if needed, or adjusting the Python path. The permanent fix would involve updating the project's dependencies and ensuring the environment is correctly configured. Prevention would include adding automated checks and monitoring.\n\nI should structure the response with Analysis, Immediate Action, Permanent Fix, Prevention, and Risk Level. Also, check if any new skills are needed. Since this is a standard Python module issue, no new skills are required beyond Python troubleshooting.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This typically occurs due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect directory structure or missing `__init__.py`).  \n3. **Virtual Environment Issue**: The code is running outside the intended virtual environment where dependencies are installed.  \n\n**Contextual Factors**:  \n- The error occurs during startup (`startup_event`), suggesting a dependency required for initialization is missing.  \n- No context is available, implying potential gaps in environment configuration or deployment scripts.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Immediate Mitigation**:  \n   - Verify the presence of `dexter_brain` in the environment.  \n   - Install the module or adjust the Python path to include its location.  \n\n2. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Ensure `dexter_brain` is explicitly listed as a dependency (e.g., in `requirements.txt`).  \n   - Validate directory structure and Python path configuration.  \n\n3. **Prevention**:  \n   - Implement dependency checks in CI/CD pipelines.  \n   - Use tools like `pip-check` or `import-linter` to detect missing modules pre-deployment.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### **Immediate_Action**  \n1. **Check Module Installation**:  \n   Run in the system's Python environment:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip show dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If not found, proceed to install.  \n\n2. **Install Missing Module**:  \n   If `dexter_brain` is a third-party package:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If it’s a local/custom module:  \n   - Ensure the directory containing `dexter_brain` is in the project root or symlinked.  \n   - Add the path to `PYTHONPATH`:  \n     ```bash  \n     export PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/dexter_brain\"  \n     ```  \n\n3. **Restart Service**:  \n   ```bash  \n   systemctl restart gliksbot-backend  \n   ```  \n\n---\n\n#### **Permanent_Fix**  \n1. **Update Dependency Management**:  \n   - Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt`:  \n     ```txt  \n     dexter_brain==<version>  \n     ```  \n   - Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to capture all dependencies.  \n\n2. **Validate Project Structure**:  \n   Ensure `dexter_brain` is in a directory listed in `sys.path`. Example structure:  \n   ```  \n   M:\\gliksbot\\  \n   ├── backend\\  \n   │   └── main.py  \n   └── dexter_brain\\  \n       ├── __init__.py  \n       └── sandbox.py  \n   ```  \n\n3. **Environment Isolation**:  \n   Use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts:  \n   ```bash  \n   python -m venv venv  \n   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate  \n   pip install -r requirements.txt  \n   ```  \n\n---\n\n#### **Prevention**  \n1. **Automated Dependency Checks**:  \n   Add a pre-deployment script to validate dependencies:  \n   ```bash  \n   # check_missing_dependencies.sh  \n   for pkg in $(cat requirements.txt | grep -v '^#'); do  \n     pip show $pkg || echo \"Missing: $pkg\"  \n   done  \n   ```  \n\n2. **Monitoring**:  \n   - Configure alerts for `ModuleNotFoundError` in logs.  \n   - Use tools like Sentry or Datadog to track startup errors.  \n\n3. **Code Hygiene**:  \n   Use `importlib.util` to check for modules at runtime (example below).  \n\n---\n\n#### **Risk_Level & Confidence**  \n- **Risk_Level**: LOW  \n  - Installing missing modules or adjusting paths is low-risk if the module is trusted.  \n  - Virtual environment setup ensures no system-wide impact.  \n- **Confidence**: HIGH  \n  - This is a common Python error with well-documented solutions.  \n\n---\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (Optional)  \nIf the team lacks Python troubleshooting expertise, define a skill:  \n```json  \n{  \n  \"skill\": \"Python Dependency Management\",  \n  \"description\": \"Ability to diagnose and resolve Python module import errors, including virtual environments, PATH configuration, and dependency tracking.\",  \n  \"tools\": [\"pip\", \"sys.path\", \"requirements.txt\", \"virtualenv\"]  \n}  \n```  \n\n--- \n\n**Vote**: This solution balances speed (immediate restart) and long-term stability (dependency management)."
