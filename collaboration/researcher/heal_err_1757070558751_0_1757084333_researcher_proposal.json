  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to parse through that first. The error is a STARTUP_ERROR with the message \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". The stack trace points to main.py trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox, which isn't found.\n\nFirst, the root cause. The error is a ModuleNotFoundError, which usually means the required module isn't installed or not in the Python path. Since it's a startup error, the system is trying to load this module during initialization. The source is 'system', so it's part of the core setup.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if the module exists in the environment. If it's a missing package, installing it would help. But maybe the module is part of the project and not properly linked. Alternatively, the Python path might not include the directory where dexter_brain is located.\n\nFor a permanent fix, ensuring the module is correctly installed or the path is set. If it's a third-party package, installing via pip. If it's a local module, making sure it's in the right directory and the environment is set up correctly. Also, checking virtual environments if they're being used.\n\nPrevention could involve adding checks during deployment to ensure all dependencies are present. Maybe using a requirements.txt file and automating the installation. Also, monitoring for missing modules during startup.\n\nRisks: If the module is not supposed to be there, installing it might introduce conflicts. Or if the path is modified incorrectly, it could break other parts. Need to verify the correct approach.\n\nNow, considering the system status with recent errors and critical ones, there might be a pattern. But the current error seems isolated to this module.\n\nSo, the analysis would point to a missing module. Immediate steps: check installation, install if needed, or adjust paths. Permanent fix: ensure dependencies are managed properly. Prevention: better dependency management and monitoring.\n\nI should structure the response with Analysis, Immediate Action, Permanent Fix, Prevention, Risk Level, and Confidence. Also, check if any new skills are needed, but in this case, it's standard Python troubleshooting.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to one of the following:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., not in the project directory or a recognized site-packages folder).  \n3. **Environment Misconfiguration**: A virtual environment is active but does not contain the required module, or the global environment is being used unintentionally.  \n\n**Context**:  \nThe error occurs during the `startup_event` in `main.py`, which attempts to import `create_sandbox` from `dexter_brain.sandbox`. This suggests `dexter_brain` is a critical dependency for system initialization.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Verify Module Existence**:  \n   - Check if `dexter_brain` is a local module (e.g., a subdirectory in the project) or a third-party package.  \n   - If local, ensure it is properly structured (e.g., contains an `__init__.py` file) and located in a directory included in `PYTHONPATH`.  \n   - If third-party, confirm it is installed in the current environment.  \n\n2. **Environment Check**:  \n   - Confirm the active Python environment (e.g., `which python` or `sys.executable` in Python).  \n   - Validate that dependencies are installed in this environment.  \n\n3. **Immediate Mitigation**:  \n   - Install the module if missing.  \n   - Adjust `PYTHONPATH` to include the module’s location if it exists but is not recognized.  \n\n4. **Long-Term Fix**:  \n   - Use a dependency manager (e.g., `pip` with `requirements.txt`) to ensure reproducibility.  \n   - Automate environment setup to avoid manual path adjustments.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### **Immediate_Action**  \n1. **Check Environment**:  \n   Run in the terminal:  \n   ```bash  \n   # Identify active Python environment  \n   which python  \n   # List installed packages  \n   pip list  \n   ```  \n\n2. **Install Missing Module**:  \n   If `dexter_brain` is a third-party package:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If it’s a local module:  \n   - Ensure the directory containing `dexter_brain` is in the project root or add it to `PYTHONPATH`:  \n     ```bash  \n     export PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/project\"  \n     ```  \n\n3. **Test Startup**:  \n   Restart the system and verify if the error persists.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Permanent_Fix**  \n1. **Dependency Management**:  \n   - Create/update a `requirements.txt` file:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip freeze > requirements.txt  \n     ```  \n   - Ensure `dexter_brain` is included (if third-party) or document its local path.  \n\n2. **Environment Automation**:  \n   - Use a virtual environment (e.g., `venv`) and activate it during deployment:  \n     ```bash  \n     python -m venv venv  \n     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate  \n     pip install -r requirements.txt  \n     ```  \n\n3. **Code Adjustments (if local module)**:  \n   - Structure the project to include `dexter_brain` in the root directory.  \n   - Example project layout:  \n     ```  \n     project/  \n     ├── main.py  \n     └── dexter_brain/  \n         ├── __init__.py  \n         └── sandbox.py  \n     ```  \n\n---\n\n#### **Prevention**  \n1. **Automated Checks**:  \n   - Add a pre-startup script to validate dependencies:  \n     ```python  \n     # check_dependencies.py  \n     try:  \n         import dexter_brain  \n     except ImportError:  \n         raise RuntimeError(\"Missing dependency: dexter_brain\")  \n     ```  \n   - Integrate this into CI/CD pipelines.  \n\n2. **Monitoring**:  \n   - Implement logging for module imports during startup.  \n   - Set up alerts for `ModuleNotFoundError` in production logs.  \n\n3. **Documentation**:  \n   - Document environment setup steps and dependencies in a `README.md`.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Risk_Level**: MEDIUM  \n- **Risk**: Installing third-party packages may introduce conflicts with existing dependencies.  \n- **Mitigation**: Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies.  \n\n#### **Confidence**: HIGH  \n- The solution addresses the most common causes of `ModuleNotFoundError` and aligns with Python best practices.  \n\n---\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (Optional)  \nIf the team lacks Python environment management expertise, provide training on:  \n- Virtual environments (`venv`, `pipenv`)  \n- Dependency management (`requirements.txt`, `pip`)  \n- Python path configuration  \n\nExample code for dependency check:  \n```python  \n# dependency_checker.py  \nimport importlib.util  \n\ndef check_module(module_name):  \n    spec = importlib.util.find_spec(module_name)  \n    if spec is None:  \n        print(f\"ERROR: Module {module_name} not found.\")  \n    else:  \n        print(f\"Module {module_name} found at {spec.origin}\")  \n\ncheck_module(\"dexter_brain\")  \n```  \n\nRun this script before startup to validate dependencies."
