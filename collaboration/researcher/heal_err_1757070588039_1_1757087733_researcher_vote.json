  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a ModuleNotFoundError for 'dexter_brain' when starting up their system. The error is a startup error, critical severity, and it's happening during the import in main.py line 120. \n\nFirst, root cause. The error message says \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\", which usually means that the Python interpreter can't find that module. So possible reasons are: the module isn't installed, it's not in the right directory, there's a typo in the name, or the Python path isn't set correctly.\n\nLooking at the context, there's no context available, so maybe the system was just started and the module isn't present. The stack trace shows the import is in main.py, so the code is trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox. If the module isn't installed or not in the Python path, this error occurs.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if the module exists. The user should verify if 'dexter_brain' is installed in the current Python environment. They can do this by running 'pip show dexter_brain' or trying to import it in a Python shell. If it's not there, installing it would be the next step. But if the module is supposed to be part of the project, maybe it's a local module that's not in the right location. They should check the project structure to ensure that 'dexter_brain' is in a directory that's part of the Python path. Alternatively, maybe the virtual environment isn't activated, so the installed packages aren't available.\n\nFor a permanent fix, if the module is a third-party package, installing it via pip would be necessary. If it's a local module, ensuring that the directory containing 'dexter_brain' is included in the PYTHONPATH environment variable or that the project structure is set up correctly so that the import works. Maybe adding the parent directory to sys.path in the code temporarily, but that's not ideal for production. A better fix would be to structure the project so that the module is in a location that's automatically included, like installing the package in development mode using setup.py or pyproject.toml.\n\nPrevention would involve setting up proper dependency management. Using a virtual environment and a requirements.txt file that includes all necessary packages, including 'dexter_brain' if it's a third-party package. Also, implementing checks during the startup process to verify that all required modules are present. Maybe adding a script that runs before startup to check for dependencies. Additionally, using linters or tools like pyright to catch import errors during development.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing package could be medium if the package isn't maintained or has dependencies that conflict with existing ones. If 'dexter_brain' is a local module, the risk might be lower if the structure is adjusted correctly. However, modifying the Python path could lead to other issues if not done properly.\n\nSo putting it all together, the root cause is that the 'dexter_brain' module isn't available in the current Python environment. Immediate action is to check if it's installed and install it if necessary, or adjust the environment to include the correct path. Permanent fix would be ensuring the module is properly installed or the project structure is correct. Prevention involves dependency management and checks. Risk level would be medium if installing a third-party package, but lower if it's a local module issue.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because the Python interpreter cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. The module is not installed in the current Python environment  \n2. The module is installed but not in a directory included in the Python path  \n3. The module name is misspelled or structurally inaccessible in the project  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify module installation: Run `pip show dexter_brain` in the project's Python environment  \n2. If missing, install via: `pip install dexter_brain` (if third-party)  \n3. If local module:  \n   a. Confirm 'dexter_brain' directory exists in project root  \n   b. Add parent directory to PYTHONPATH: `export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/project:$PYTHONPATH`  \n4. Test import in Python shell: `python -c \"import dexter_brain\"`  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. For third-party modules:  \n   - Add `dexter_brain` to requirements.txt  \n   - Implement pipenv/virtualenv dependency management  \n2. For local modules:  \n   - Structure project as package with `setup.py`  \n   - Install in development mode: `pip install -e .`  \n   - Use relative imports or adjust sys.path in code if necessary  \n\nPrevention:  \n1. Add pre-startup dependency check script  \n2. Use CI/CD pipeline to validate imports  \n3. Implement Python path validation in startup_event handler  \n4. Use pyproject.toml with explicit dependencies  \n\nRisk_Level: MEDIUM (Potential dependency conflicts if installing third-party packages)  \nConfidence: HIGH (Standard Python module resolution patterns apply)  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
