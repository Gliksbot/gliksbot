  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user provided a detailed error message: \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". The error is a startup error, critical severity, happening during the import in main.py line 120. The system is trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox but can't find the module.\n\nFirst, root cause analysis. The most common reason for a ModuleNotFoundError is that the module isn't installed in the Python environment. Alternatively, the module might be installed but not in the right location, or there's a typo in the import statement. Since the error occurs during startup, it's likely that the dexter_brain package isn't installed in the environment where the backend is running.\n\nLooking at the context, there's no context available, so we can't see the environment setup. But the error is straightforward. The system is looking for a module that's missing. So possible causes: missing package installation, incorrect Python path, or a missing dependency in the project.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if the package is installed. If not, install it. But since the user might not have access to the environment, the solution needs to be actionable. The permanent fix would involve ensuring the package is included in the dependencies and installed correctly. Prevention could involve adding checks during deployment or including the package in the requirements.\n\nRisk assessment: Installing a missing package is generally low risk, but if the package isn't maintained or has security issues, that could be a problem. However, since the system expects it, it's probably a necessary package.\n\nSo, the analysis is that the dexter_brain module isn't installed. Immediate action is to install it using pip. Permanent fix would be to add it to the requirements.txt or setup.py so that it's installed automatically in the environment. Prevention could involve adding a check in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure all dependencies are installed. Risk level is low because installing a required package is standard, but confidence is high because the error message directly points to the missing module.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python environment where the backend is running does not have the `dexter_brain` package installed or accessible. This is likely due to:  \n1. Missing installation of the `dexter_brain` package.  \n2. Incorrect Python path configuration (e.g., the package is installed in a different environment or directory).  \n3. A dependency missing from the project's requirements (e.g., not listed in `requirements.txt`).  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Immediate Action**:  \n   - Verify if `dexter_brain` is installed in the current Python environment.  \n   - Install the missing package using `pip` or the appropriate package manager.  \n   - Restart the backend service to apply changes.  \n\n2. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Add `dexter_brain` to the project's dependency list (e.g., `requirements.txt` or `setup.py`) to ensure it is installed in all environments.  \n   - Validate the package source (e.g., internal repository, PyPI, or local directory).  \n\n3. **Prevention**:  \n   - Implement dependency checks during deployment (e.g., CI/CD pipeline steps to validate `requirements.txt`).  \n   - Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies and avoid path conflicts.  \n\n4. **Risk Assessment**:  \n   - **Risk Level**: LOW (installing a required package is standard, but ensure the package is trusted).  \n   - **Confidence**: HIGH (the error directly points to the missing module).  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### Immediate_Action  \n1. **Check Installation**:  \n   Run in the backend environment:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip show dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If not found, proceed to install.  \n\n2. **Install the Package**:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   *If the package is hosted privately (e.g., internal repo):*  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install --extra-index-url https://private-repo.example.com dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n\n3. **Restart Service**:  \n   ```bash  \n   systemctl restart gliksbot-backend  \n   # or  \n   pkill -f main.py && python M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\main.py  \n   ```  \n\n---\n\n#### Permanent_Fix  \n1. **Update Dependencies**:  \n   Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt`:  \n   ```txt  \n   dexter_brain==<version>  \n   ```  \n   Or pin the version in `setup.py` if using a package manager.  \n\n2. **Validate Package Source**:  \n   If `dexter_brain` is a local/internal package, ensure it is included in the project repository or build artifacts.  \n\n---\n\n#### Prevention  \n1. **CI/CD Pipeline Check**:  \n   Add a step to validate dependencies during deployment:  \n   ```yaml  \n   # Example GitHub Actions step  \n   - name: Check dependencies  \n     run: |  \n       pip install -r requirements.txt --target ./dependencies  \n       find ./dependencies -name \"dexter_brain\"  \n   ```  \n\n2. **Environment Isolation**:  \n   Use virtual environments (e.g., `venv`) to avoid global Python package conflicts:  \n   ```bash  \n   python -m venv venv  \n   source venv/bin/activate  \n   pip install -r requirements.txt  \n   ```  \n\n---\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (Optional)  \nIf the `dexter_brain` package is not available externally, create a placeholder package for testing:  \n```python  \n# dexter_brain/__init__.py  \nprint(\"dexter_brain module loaded\")  \n\n# dexter_brain/sandbox.py  \ndef create_sandbox():  \n    return \"Sandbox initialized\"  \n```  \nInstall it locally:  \n```bash  \npip install -e .  \n```  \n\n--- \n\n**Final Note**: Confirm the package version and source with the development team to ensure compatibility."
