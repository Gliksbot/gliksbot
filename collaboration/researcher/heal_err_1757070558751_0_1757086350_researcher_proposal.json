  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to parse through that. The error is a STARTUP_ERROR with the message \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". The stack trace points to main.py trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nFirst, root cause analysis. The error is a ModuleNotFoundError, which usually means Python can't find the required module. So why isn't 'dexter_brain' available? Possible reasons: the module isn't installed, it's not in the right directory, there's a typo in the name, or the Python path isn't set correctly.\n\nLooking at the context, there's no context available, so maybe the environment isn't set up properly. The system status shows recent and critical errors, but not sure if that's related. The error occurred during startup, so it's a dependency issue.\n\nImmediate action: Check if the module exists in the environment. If it's a package, maybe it needs to be installed. If it's a local module, check the file structure. The user might need to install the package via pip or ensure the directory is in the Python path.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure the module is properly installed or linked. If it's a third-party package, add it to requirements.txt. If it's internal, make sure the directory is included in the project structure and the PYTHONPATH is set correctly.\n\nPrevention: Implement dependency checks before startup, maybe a script that verifies all required modules are present. Also, use virtual environments to isolate dependencies and avoid conflicts.\n\nRisk assessment: The immediate action might involve installing packages, which could have compatibility issues. The permanent fix could involve changing environment configurations, which might affect other parts of the system. Need to test changes in a staging environment first.\n\nNow, structuring the response as per the user's format. Analysis, Immediate Action, Permanent Fix, Prevention, Risk Level, Confidence.\n\nWait, the user also mentioned a collaboration session with LLMs. So maybe they want a team approach. But the initial proposal needs to be my analysis. Also, if a new skill is needed, provide SKILL_SPEC and code. But in this case, the solution is more about Python environment management, so maybe no new skill required. But perhaps a script to check dependencies.\n\nImplementation steps: For immediate action, check if 'dexter_brain' is installed. If not, install it. If it's a local module, check the import path. For permanent fix, ensure the package is in requirements.txt or the directory is correctly structured. Prevention could be adding a pre-start check.\n\nRisk level: Medium, because installing packages might introduce new issues, but necessary. Confidence: High, since ModuleNotFoundError is straightforward.\n\nI need to make sure all sections are covered. Let me draft each part.\n</think>\n\n# **Analysis**  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that Python cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in a directory included in the `PYTHONPATH` or project structure.  \n3. **Typo/Case Sensitivity**: A mismatch in the module name (e.g., `Dexter_Brain` vs. `dexter_brain`).  \n4. **Virtual Environment Issue**: The module is installed in a different environment than the one being used.  \n\nThe error occurs during the `startup_event` in `main.py`, suggesting the module is critical for initialization.  \n\n---\n\n# **Approach**  \n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the module's presence and install it if missing.  \n2. **Permanent Fix**: Ensure the module is properly integrated into the project (via installation, path configuration, or version control).  \n3. **Prevention**: Implement dependency validation and environment consistency checks.  \n\n---\n\n# **Implementation**  \n\n## **Immediate Action**  \n1. **Check Module Installation**:  \n   Run in the project's environment:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip show dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If not found, install it (if itâ€™s a third-party package):  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n\n2. **Verify Local Module Path**:  \n   If `dexter_brain` is a local directory, ensure it is in the same directory as `main.py` or add its path to `PYTHONPATH`:  \n   ```bash  \n   export PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/dexter_brain\"  \n   ```  \n\n3. **Check for Typos**:  \n   Confirm the module name in `main.py` matches the actual folder/file name (case-sensitive).  \n\n---\n\n## **Permanent Fix**  \n1. **Add to Requirements**:  \n   If `dexter_brain` is a third-party package, add it to `requirements.txt`:  \n   ```  \n   dexter_brain==<version>  \n   ```  \n   Then reinstall dependencies:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install -r requirements.txt  \n   ```  \n\n2. **Version Control Integration**:  \n   If `dexter_brain` is an internal module, ensure it is included in the repository and properly referenced in the project structure.  \n\n3. **Environment Configuration**:  \n   Use a virtual environment (e.g., `venv`) and activate it before running the application:  \n   ```bash  \n   python -m venv venv  \n   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS  \n   venv\\Scripts\\activate     # Windows  \n   ```  \n\n---\n\n## **Prevention**  \n1. **Pre-Startup Dependency Check**:  \n   Add a script to validate required modules before startup. Example `check_dependencies.py`:  \n   ```python  \n   # check_dependencies.py  \n   import importlib.util  \n\n   REQUIRED_MODULES = [\"dexter_brain\"]  \n\n   for module in REQUIRED_MODULES:  \n       if not importlib.util.find_spec(module):  \n           raise ModuleNotFoundError(f\"Missing required module: {module}\")  \n   ```  \n   Run this script before starting the application.  \n\n2. **CI/CD Integration**:  \n   Add dependency checks to CI/CD pipelines to catch missing modules early.  \n\n3. **Environment Locking**:  \n   Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to lock dependency versions and ensure consistency.  \n\n---\n\n## **Risk Assessment**  \n- **Risk Level**: **MEDIUM**  \n  - Installing new packages could introduce conflicts, but this is mitigated by using virtual environments.  \n  - Path modifications may affect other projects if not isolated.  \n- **Confidence**: **HIGH**  \n  - The solution directly addresses the root cause of the `ModuleNotFoundError`.  \n\n---\n\n# **SKILL_SPEC (Optional)**  \nIf dependency validation is not part of the existing workflow, implement a new skill for automated environment checks:  \n\n```python  \n# skill_environment_validator.py  \ndef validate_environment():  \n    required = [\"dexter_brain\"]  \n    missing = [mod for mod in required if not importlib.util.find_spec(mod)]  \n    if missing:  \n        raise RuntimeError(f\"Missing modules: {', '.join(missing)}\")  \n    return \"Environment validated successfully\"  \n```  \n\nIntegrate this into the startup script or CI/CD pipeline.  \n\n--- \n\n**Vote**: This solution balances immediate resolution with long-term stability."
