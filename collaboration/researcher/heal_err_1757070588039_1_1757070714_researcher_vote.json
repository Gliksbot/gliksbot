  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\" error when starting up their system. The error is a startup error, critical severity, and it's happening in the main.py file when trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nFirst, root cause. The error message clearly states that the module 'dexter_brain' isn't found. That usually means the module isn't installed, not in the Python path, or there's a typo in the import statement. Since the context isn't available, I have to assume the code is correct. So possible reasons: the package isn't installed, the environment isn't set up correctly, or the module is missing from the project structure.\n\nImmediate action: The user needs to check if the module exists. They should look in the project directory to see if 'dexter_brain' is present. If it's a third-party package, they might need to install it via pip. If it's a local module, maybe the directory isn't in the PYTHONPATH. They could also try reinstalling dependencies or checking virtual environment activation.\n\nPermanent fix: If the module is part of the project, ensuring it's included in the repository and properly structured. If it's a third-party package, adding it to requirements.txt and installing it. Also, checking the import statements for correctness. Maybe setting up a virtual environment and installing all dependencies properly.\n\nPrevention: Implementing dependency management, using virtual environments, and ensuring that all required modules are included in the project's dependencies. Also, adding checks in the CI/CD pipeline to verify that all imports are valid before deployment.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing package could be low if it's a known dependency. However, if 'dexter_brain' is a custom module that's missing, there might be more underlying issues. The confidence here would depend on whether the module is supposed to be present or not.\n\nWait, the error is in the system source, so maybe 'dexter_brain' is a custom module that's part of the project. If that's the case, the user might have deleted it or not included it in their current setup. So checking the project structure is crucial. If the module is missing, they need to restore it from version control or reinstall the project.\n\nAnother angle: The Python path might not include the directory where 'dexter_brain' is located. So adding the project root to PYTHONPATH could resolve it. For example, setting PYTHONPATH environment variable or modifying sys.path in the code.\n\nImmediate steps could be:\n\n1. Check if 'dexter_brain' exists in the project directory.\n2. If it's a package, install it using pip.\n3. If it's a local module, ensure the directory is in the Python path.\n4. Check for typos in the import statement.\n\nPermanent fix would involve ensuring that the module is properly included in the project's dependencies and environment setup.\n\nPrevention could involve using a requirements.txt file, virtual environments, and automated tests that check for missing modules.\n\nRisk level for the solution: If the module is a third-party package, installing it is low risk. If it's a local module that's missing, restoring it might be necessary, which could have higher risk if the module is not available.\n\nConfidence in the solution would be high if the module is a known dependency that's missing, medium if the structure is incorrect but fixable.\n\nSo putting it all together, the root cause is the missing module. Immediate action is to check and install or add the module. Permanent fix is to ensure dependencies are managed. Prevention through better dependency tracking. Risk is low to medium depending on the module's origin.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because the Python interpreter cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. The module is not installed in the current Python environment  \n2. The module exists but is not in the Python path  \n3. The module was accidentally deleted or misnamed  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' is a local module by checking the project directory structure  \n2. If missing locally, check if it's a third-party package (search PyPI) and install via:  \n   `pip install dexter-brain` (if available)  \n3. If it's a local module, ensure the containing directory is in PYTHONPATH:  \n   `set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;M:\\gliksbot\\backend` (Windows)  \n   or `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/gliksbot/backend` (Linux/Mac)  \n4. If using a virtual environment, ensure it's activated and contains required dependencies  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. If 'dexter_brain' is a custom module:  \n   - Confirm it exists in the repository and restore from version control if missing  \n   - Ensure proper directory structure: `M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\dexter_brain\\__init__.py`  \n2. If it's a third-party dependency:  \n   - Add to `requirements.txt`: `dexter-brain==x.x.x`  \n   - Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  \n3. Implement dependency management:  \n   - Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to capture all dependencies  \n   - Use virtual environments for isolation  \n\nPrevention:  \n1. Add pre-startup checks to validate module availability  \n2. Implement CI/CD pipeline checks for import validity  \n3. Use `__init__.py` files to ensure directories are recognized as packages  \n4. Monitor for missing modules with logging:  \n   ```python\n   try:\n       import dexter_brain\n   except ImportError as e:\n       logger.critical(\"Missing dependency: %s\", e)\n   ```  \n\nRisk_Level: LOW  \nConfidence: HIGH  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
