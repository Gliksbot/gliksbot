  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a ModuleNotFoundError for 'dexter_brain' when starting up their system. The error is critical and happening during startup, which means the system can't initialize properly.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the root cause. The error message says the module isn't found. That usually means one of a few things: the module isn't installed, it's not in the right directory, there's a typo in the name, or there's an issue with the Python path. Since the error is in the startup_event in main.py, it's trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox. So the module 'dexter_brain' isn't present where Python is looking.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if the module is installed. If it's a package, maybe they need to install it via pip. If it's a local module, maybe the directory structure is wrong. They should check the Python path to ensure that the directory containing dexter_brain is included. Alternatively, if the module is part of the project, maybe it's missing from the repository or not properly linked.\n\nFor a permanent fix, they need to ensure that the module is correctly installed or linked. If it's a third-party package, installing it would fix it. If it's a local module, adding the directory to PYTHONPATH or setting up a symlink might work. Also, checking the import statement for typos is important.\n\nPrevention would involve setting up checks in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure all dependencies are installed and that the environment is correctly configured. Maybe adding a requirements.txt or using a virtual environment that includes all necessary packages. Also, monitoring for missing modules during deployment could catch this earlier.\n\nRisk assessment: The immediate action of installing a package might introduce new dependencies or conflicts, but if it's a known package, the risk is low. The permanent fix of adjusting the environment variables or directory structure is safe if done correctly. The prevention steps are low risk and standard practice.\n\nConfidence in this solution is high because missing module errors are common and usually straightforward to resolve once the cause is identified. The key is determining whether the module is supposed to be a third-party package or a local one. If the user has access to the codebase, checking the directory structure and setup instructions would clarify that.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because Python cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. Missing installation of a required package containing 'dexter_brain'  \n2. Incorrect Python path configuration preventing discovery of the module  \n3. Missing or misconfigured local module files  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' is a third-party package:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter_brain  # If publicly available  \n   ```  \n2. If local module:  \n   - Confirm 'dexter_brain' directory exists in project root  \n   - Add directory to PYTHONPATH:  \n     ```bash  \n     export PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/gliksbot\"  \n     ```  \n3. Check for typos in import statement (case-sensitive)  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. For third-party dependency:  \n   - Add to requirements.txt:  \n     ```  \n     dexter_brain==<version>  \n     ```  \n   - Ensure virtual environment is activated during startup  \n2. For local module:  \n   - Create symbolic link in project root:  \n     ```bash  \n     ln -s /absolute/path/to/dexter_brain .  \n     ```  \n   - Or modify sys.path in main.py:  \n     ```python  \n     import sys  \n     sys.path.append('/absolute/path/to/dexter_brain')  \n     ```  \n\nPrevention:  \n1. Implement dependency checks in CI/CD pipeline:  \n   ```bash  \n   # In CI config  \n   - pip freeze > requirements.txt  \n   - diff requirements.txt requirements.lock  \n   ```  \n2. Add pre-startup validation script:  \n   ```python  \n   # validate_modules.py  \n   try:  \n       import dexter_brain  \n   except ImportError:  \n       raise RuntimeError(\"Missing critical module: dexter_brain\")  \n   ```  \n3. Monitor Python path configuration in runtime logs  \n\nRisk_Level: LOW  \nConfidence: HIGH  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
