  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through it step by step.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The traceback shows it's happening in main.py during the startup_event, specifically when importing from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nLooking at the error details, it's a STARTUP_ERROR of CRITICAL severity. The system is trying to start up but can't because the module is missing. The context isn't available, so maybe the environment isn't set up correctly. The system status shows recent and critical errors, so this might be part of a larger issue, but focusing on this specific error first.\n\nRoot cause analysis: The most likely reason is that the 'dexter_brain' package isn't installed in the Python environment where the application is running. Alternatively, the Python path might not include the directory where dexter_brain is located. Another possibility is a typo in the module name, but the error message seems to indicate the exact name is missing.\n\nImmediate action: The user needs to check if the module exists and is installed. They can try installing it via pip if it's a third-party package. If it's a local module, ensuring that the directory is in the PYTHONPATH or that the package is properly structured with __init__.py files.\n\nPermanent fix: Installing the missing package or adding the correct path to the Python environment. If it's a local module, maybe the project structure needs adjustment, or the package needs to be installed in development mode.\n\nPrevention: Setting up monitoring to check for missing modules during deployment, using virtual environments to ensure all dependencies are present, and implementing automated tests that check for import errors.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a new package could be medium if it introduces dependencies that conflict with existing ones. If it's a local module, the risk is lower as it's part of the project's own codebase.\n\nNow, considering the user's request for a solution approach. They need specific steps. Let me outline the analysis, approach, and implementation.\n\nFor the SKILL_SPEC, if the solution requires a new skill, but in this case, it's more about Python module handling, which is standard. So maybe no new skill needed. But if the user needs a script to check module availability, that could be a code snippet.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"If this requires a new skill, provide a SKILL_SPEC and code\". Since this is a standard Python error, probably no new skill is needed. But maybe a script to verify the module installation or check paths.\n\nImplementation steps would include checking the installed packages, installing if necessary, checking the Python path, and modifying it if needed. Also, ensuring that the package is correctly structured.\n\nI need to structure the response into Analysis, Approach, and Implementation as per the user's request. The initial proposal should have those sections. Also, the user is part of a collaboration session, so the response should be clear for the team.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This typically occurs due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in a directory included in the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.  \n3. **Package Structure Issue**: The module lacks proper `__init__.py` files or is not structured as a valid Python package.  \n\n**Context**:  \n- The error occurs during the `startup_event` in `main.py`, suggesting the system relies on `dexter_brain` for core functionality.  \n- No context is available, implying potential gaps in deployment or environment configuration.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Immediate Verification**:  \n   - Confirm whether `dexter_brain` is a third-party package or a local module.  \n   - Check if the module is installed in the current environment.  \n   - Validate the Python path to ensure it includes the module’s location.  \n\n2. **Temporary Fix**:  \n   - Install the module (if third-party) or adjust the Python path (if local).  \n\n3. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Ensure the module is included in the project’s dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt`).  \n   - Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies and avoid path conflicts.  \n\n4. **Prevention**:  \n   - Implement automated checks for missing modules during deployment.  \n   - Use CI/CD pipelines to validate environment setup.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### **Immediate_Action**  \n1. **Check Installed Packages**:  \n   Run the following command to verify if `dexter_brain` is installed:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip show dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If not found, proceed to install it (if third-party) or locate the local module.  \n\n2. **Install Missing Module (if applicable)**:  \n   If `dexter_brain` is a third-party package:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If it’s a local module, ensure the directory containing `dexter_brain` is in the project root or add it to `PYTHONPATH`:  \n   ```bash  \n   export PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/dexter_brain\"  \n   ```  \n\n3. **Verify Path**:  \n   Temporarily modify `main.py` to print the current Python path for debugging:  \n   ```python  \n   import sys  \n   print(\"Python Path:\", sys.path)  \n   ```  \n\n---\n\n#### **Permanent_Fix**  \n1. **Dependency Management**:  \n   - Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` (if third-party):  \n     ```txt  \n     dexter_brain==<version>  \n     ```  \n   - If local, ensure the module is included in the project repository and structured as a package (with `__init__.py`).  \n\n2. **Environment Isolation**:  \n   Use a virtual environment to avoid path conflicts:  \n   ```bash  \n   python -m venv venv  \n   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate  \n   pip install -r requirements.txt  \n   ```  \n\n3. **Code Adjustments**:  \n   If the module is local, adjust imports to use relative paths or restructure the project to align with Python’s module resolution rules.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Prevention**  \n1. **Automated Checks**:  \n   Add a pre-startup script to validate critical dependencies:  \n   ```bash  \n   # check_dependencies.sh  \n   python -c \"import dexter_brain\" || { echo \"Missing module: dexter_brain\"; exit 1; }  \n   ```  \n\n2. **CI/CD Integration**:  \n   Include a test in CI pipelines to ensure all imports work:  \n   ```yaml  \n   # Example GitHub Actions step  \n   - name: Test imports  \n     run: |  \n       python -c \"import dexter_brain\"  \n   ```  \n\n---\n\n#### **Risk Assessment**  \n- **Risk Level**: **LOW** (Installing a missing module or adjusting paths is low-risk if tested in a staging environment).  \n- **Confidence**: **HIGH** (The error is a common Python issue with well-documented solutions).  \n\n---\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (Optional)  \nIf the team lacks Python troubleshooting skills, define a skill for module resolution:  \n```json  \n{  \n  \"skill\": \"Python Module Resolution\",  \n  \"description\": \"Ability to diagnose and resolve missing module errors in Python environments.\",  \n  \"code_snippet\": \"import sys; print(sys.path)\"  \n}  \n```  \n\nThis approach balances rapid resolution with long-term stability, ensuring minimal disruption to operations."
