  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to parse through it carefully. The error is a STARTUP_ERROR with the message \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". The stack trace points to line 120 in main.py trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nFirst, the root cause. The error is a ModuleNotFoundError, which typically means that the Python interpreter can't find the specified module. So, the 'dexter_brain' module isn't installed or not in the Python path. But why? Maybe the module isn't installed in the current environment, or it's installed but the environment isn't correctly set up. Alternatively, there could be a typo in the module name, but the error message shows 'dexter_brain' exactly as in the import statement, so that's less likely.\n\nLooking at the context, there's no context available, so I can't see if there were recent changes. But the system status shows 8 recent errors and 2 critical ones, with 2 related startup errors. This might indicate a recurring issue, possibly after a deployment or environment change.\n\nImmediate action: The user needs to check if the module is installed. They can run 'pip list' to see installed packages. If it's not there, install it. But maybe the module is a local package that needs to be built or added to the path. Alternatively, the project might have a dependency that's missing in the requirements.txt. So, checking the environment and installing the missing module would be the first step.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure that the module is included in the project's dependencies. If it's a third-party package, add it to requirements.txt. If it's a local module, make sure it's properly structured and included in the source directory. Also, check the Python path in the environment to ensure it's looking in the right place. Maybe setting up a virtual environment and installing all dependencies properly.\n\nPrevention: Implement dependency checks during deployment, maybe a pre-start script that verifies all required modules are present. Also, using a requirements.txt file and ensuring that deployments use that to install dependencies. Monitoring for ModuleNotFoundError in logs and setting up alerts. Code reviews to catch missing imports or dependencies.\n\nRisk assessment: The immediate action of installing the module might have risks if the module isn't compatible with other dependencies, but since the error is straightforward, the risk is low. The permanent fix involves ensuring dependencies are managed correctly, which is standard practice and low risk.\n\nWait, but what if 'dexter_brain' is a custom module that's part of the project? Then the issue might be that the project structure isn't correct, or the module isn't in the right directory. In that case, the solution would involve checking the file structure, ensuring that the module is present, and that the Python path includes the project root. Alternatively, the module might need to be installed in development mode.\n\nSo, possible steps: Check if 'dexter_brain' is a package that exists in the project directory. If it's a local package, maybe the user needs to install it using 'pip install -e .' or ensure that the directory is in the PYTHONPATH. If it's a third-party package, install it via pip.\n\nAnother angle: The error occurs during startup, so maybe the environment where the application is running doesn't have the same dependencies as the development environment. For example, deploying to a server without installing all required packages.\n\nSo, the analysis would be that the 'dexter_brain' module is missing from the Python environment where the application is running. The immediate action is to install the missing module. The permanent fix is to ensure that all dependencies are properly listed and installed in the environment. Prevention would involve better dependency management and checks.\n\nI should structure the response with Analysis, Immediate Action, Permanent Fix, Prevention, and Risk Assessment as per the user's request. Also, check if any new skills are needed. Since this is a standard Python module issue, probably no new skills required. But if the module is a custom one, maybe the user needs to package it properly. However, the error message doesn't indicate that, so assuming it's a missing package.\n\nSo, the proposal would be:\n\nAnalysis: The error is due to the absence of the 'dexter_brain' module in the Python environment.\n\nImmediate Action: Install the module via pip, check requirements.txt, ensure environment is correct.\n\nPermanent Fix: Add the module to dependencies, ensure proper installation during deployment.\n\nPrevention: Use dependency management tools, pre-start checks.\n\nRisk Level: Low, as installing a missing module is straightforward.\n\nConfidence: High, since the error is clear.\n</think>\n\n### **Analysis**  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., a local package not properly linked).  \n3. **Dependency Mismanagement**: The module is a dependency not listed in `requirements.txt`, leading to omission during deployment.  \n\nThe error recurs (2/3 attempts) and aligns with recent critical errors, suggesting a systemic issue in environment setup or deployment.  \n\n---\n\n### **Approach**  \n1. **Immediate Action**:  \n   - Verify if `dexter_brain` is installed in the target environment.  \n   - If missing, install it or ensure it is included in dependencies.  \n   - Validate Python path configuration.  \n\n2. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Ensure `dexter_brain` is explicitly listed in `requirements.txt` (if third-party) or properly structured as a local package.  \n   - Automate dependency installation during deployment.  \n\n3. **Prevention**:  \n   - Implement pre-startup dependency checks.  \n   - Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies.  \n   - Monitor for missing modules in logs.  \n\n---\n\n### **Implementation**  \n\n#### **Immediate_Action**  \n1. **Check Installation**:  \n   Run in the environment where the app runs:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip list | grep dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If not found, install it:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter_brain  # If third-party  \n   ```  \n\n2. **Local Package Setup**:  \n   If `dexter_brain` is a local module:  \n   - Ensure it is in the project directory (e.g., `M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\dexter_brain`).  \n   - Add the project root to `PYTHONPATH`:  \n     ```bash  \n     export PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:/M/gliksbot/backend\"  \n     ```  \n\n3. **Test Startup**:  \n   Restart the service and verify if the error persists.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Permanent_Fix**  \n1. **Update Dependencies**:  \n   - If `dexter_brain` is third-party, add it to `requirements.txt`:  \n     ```  \n     dexter_brain==<version>  \n     ```  \n   - If local, ensure it is included in the project repository and structured as a package (with `__init__.py`).  \n\n2. **Automate Installation**:  \n   Modify deployment scripts to install dependencies:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install -r requirements.txt  \n   ```  \n\n3. **Environment Isolation**:  \n   Use a virtual environment (e.g., `venv`) to avoid global package conflicts:  \n   ```bash  \n   python -m venv venv  \n   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate  \n   pip install -r requirements.txt  \n   ```  \n\n---\n\n#### **Prevention**  \n1. **Pre-Startup Check Script**:  \n   Create a script to validate dependencies before startup:  \n   ```python  \n   # check_dependencies.py  \n   import importlib.util  \n   required = [\"dexter_brain\"]  \n   for module in required:  \n       if not importlib.util.find_spec(module):  \n           raise ImportError(f\"Missing module: {module}\")  \n   ```  \n   Run it during deployment:  \n   ```bash  \n   python check_dependencies.py  \n   ```  \n\n2. **Monitoring**:  \n   - Log `ModuleNotFoundError` occurrences and trigger alerts.  \n   - Use tools like `Sentry` or `Prometheus` for error tracking.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Risk_Level**  \n**LOW**  \n- Installing a missing module or adjusting paths carries minimal risk.  \n- Automation steps (e.g., dependency checks) reduce human error.  \n\n#### **Confidence**  \n**HIGH**  \n- The error is straightforward, and the solution aligns with standard Python troubleshooting.  \n\n---\n\n### **SKILL_SPEC (Optional)**  \nIf the team lacks Python environment management expertise, define a skill:  \n```json  \n{  \n  \"skill\": \"Python Dependency Management\",  \n  \"description\": \"Ability to manage Python packages, virtual environments, and resolve import errors.\",  \n  \"tools\": [\"pip\", \"venv\", \"requirements.txt\"]  \n}  \n```  \n\n--- \n\n**Vote**: This solution balances speed (immediate install) and robustness (permanent fixes) with low risk."
