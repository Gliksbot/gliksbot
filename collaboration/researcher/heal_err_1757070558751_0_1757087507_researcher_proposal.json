  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That's a Python import error. The system is trying to start up but can't find the 'dexter_brain' module. The traceback points to line 120 in main.py where it's trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nSo, the root cause is probably that the 'dexter_brain' package isn't installed in the Python environment where the backend is running. Alternatively, it might be installed but not in the right location, or there's an issue with the Python path.\n\nLooking at the system status, there are 99 recent errors and 2 critical ones, including this one. The error is a startup error, so it's preventing the system from initializing properly. The mission is to diagnose and fix this.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if the module exists. Maybe the virtual environment isn't activated, or the package wasn't installed. They might need to install it using pip, or maybe it's a local package that's not in the right directory. Also, checking the Python path to ensure that the directory containing 'dexter_brain' is included.\n\nFor a permanent fix, ensuring that the package is properly installed in the environment. If it's a third-party package, installing it via requirements.txt. If it's a local module, making sure it's in the correct directory structure and that the __init__.py files are present. Also, setting up proper dependencies in the deployment process.\n\nPrevention could involve adding checks during deployment to verify that all required modules are installed. Maybe integrating a linter or a dependency checker that runs before startup. Also, monitoring for missing modules and setting up alerts.\n\nRisk assessment: The immediate action of installing the module might have a low risk if done correctly. But if the module isn't supposed to be there, it could introduce other issues. The permanent fix would involve ensuring the environment is correctly set up, which is a standard practice and low risk.\n\nWait, but how do I know if 'dexter_brain' is a third-party or internal module? The name suggests it might be a custom module for the system. So maybe it's part of the project but not properly included in the deployment. The user might need to check the project structure and ensure that the module is in the Python path.\n\nAnother possibility is that the package was installed but under a different name. Sometimes packages have different import names than their installation names. For example, installing 'dexter-brain' via pip but importing as 'dexter_brain'. But that's less likely here.\n\nSo, steps for immediate action: Check if the module exists in the environment. If not, install it. If it's a local module, check the directory structure and sys.path. For permanent fix, ensure that the deployment process includes installing all dependencies, including this module. Maybe adding it to setup.py or requirements.txt.\n\nPrevention: Implement a pre-startup check that verifies all required modules are present. Maybe a script that runs 'python -c \"import dexter_brain\"' and exits if it fails, which could be part of the deployment pipeline.\n\nRisk level for the solution: Low, since installing a missing module is straightforward. Confidence is high if the module is available and correctly named.\n\nI should structure the answer according to the user's requested format. Analysis, Immediate Action, Permanent Fix, Prevention, Risk Level, Confidence. Also, the approach and implementation steps.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in the Python path (`sys.path`).  \n3. **Deployment Issue**: The module is part of the project but was not included in the deployment package.  \n\n**Context**:  \n- The error occurs during startup (`startup_event` in `main.py`), preventing system initialization.  \n- No context is available, suggesting potential gaps in deployment or environment configuration.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Immediate Action**:  \n   - Verify the presence of `dexter_brain` in the environment.  \n   - Install or link the module if missing.  \n2. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Ensure the module is included in the deployment pipeline (e.g., via `requirements.txt` or project structure).  \n   - Validate Python path configuration.  \n3. **Prevention**:  \n   - Add pre-startup dependency checks.  \n   - Implement monitoring for missing modules.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### **Immediate Action**  \n1. **Check Module Installation**:  \n   Run in the backend environment:  \n   ```bash  \n   python -c \"import dexter_brain; print('Module exists')\"  \n   ```  \n   If the module is missing, proceed to install.  \n\n2. **Install the Module**:  \n   - If `dexter_brain` is a third-party package:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install dexter-brain  # Check PyPI for correct name  \n     ```  \n   - If it’s a local/custom module:  \n     - Ensure the directory containing `dexter_brain/__init__.py` is in the project root or a path listed in `sys.path`.  \n     - Alternatively, symlink the module to the project directory.  \n\n3. **Verify Python Path**:  \n   Add this to `main.py` (temporarily) to debug:  \n   ```python  \n   import sys  \n   print(\"Python Path:\", sys.path)  \n   ```  \n   Ensure the path includes the directory where `dexter_brain` is located.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Permanent Fix**  \n1. **Update Deployment Pipeline**:  \n   - If `dexter_brain` is a local module, ensure it’s included in the project repository and deployed alongside `main.py`.  \n   - If it’s a dependency, add it to `requirements.txt`:  \n     ```txt  \n     dexter-brain==x.x.x  # Replace with version  \n     ```  \n   - Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:  \n     ```bash  \n     python -m venv venv  \n     source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS  \n     venv\\Scripts\\activate  # Windows  \n     pip install -r requirements.txt  \n     ```  \n\n2. **Adjust Project Structure**:  \n   Ensure `dexter_brain` is at the same level as `main.py` or in a subdirectory included in `sys.path`. Example structure:  \n   ```  \n   gliksbot/  \n   ├── backend/  \n   │   ├── main.py  \n   │   └── dexter_brain/  \n   │       └── __init__.py  \n   └── requirements.txt  \n   ```  \n\n---\n\n#### **Prevention**  \n1. **Pre-Startup Check Script**:  \n   Create a script `prestart.py` to validate dependencies:  \n   ```python  \n   # prestart.py  \n   try:  \n       import dexter_brain  \n       print(\"Dependency check: dexter_brain OK\")  \n   except ImportError:  \n       raise RuntimeError(\"Missing dependency: dexter_brain\")  \n   ```  \n   Run this before starting the backend:  \n   ```bash  \n   python prestart.py && python main.py  \n   ```  \n\n2. **Monitoring**:  \n   - Add logging for missing modules in startup scripts.  \n   - Use tools like `Sentry` or `Prometheus` to alert on `ModuleNotFoundError`.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Risk Assessment**  \n- **Risk Level**: **LOW**  \n  Installing a missing module or adjusting the Python path is low-risk if done in a controlled environment.  \n- **Confidence**: **HIGH**  \n  The solution directly addresses the root cause (missing module) and aligns with standard Python dependency management.  \n\n---\n\n### Final Proposal  \n**Analysis**: Missing `dexter_brain` module causing startup failure.  \n**Immediate Action**: Install the module or adjust the Python path.  \n**Permanent Fix**: Ensure deployment includes the module and validate dependencies.  \n**Prevention**: Add pre-startup checks and monitoring.  \n**Risk Level**: LOW  \n**Confidence**: HIGH  \n\nVote for this solution as it balances rapid resolution with long-term stability."
