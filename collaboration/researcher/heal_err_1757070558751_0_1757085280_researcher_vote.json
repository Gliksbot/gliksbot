  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a ModuleNotFoundError for 'dexter_brain' when starting up the system. The error is critical and happening during startup, which means the system can't initialize properly.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out why Python can't find the dexter_brain module. Common reasons for this are that the module isn't installed, there's a typo in the name, or the Python path isn't set correctly. Since the error is happening in the backend code (main.py line 120), it's likely that the dexter_brain package is supposed to be part of the project but isn't available in the environment.\n\nLooking at the context, there's no context available, so I can't see if there are any recent changes or deployments that might have caused this. But the system status shows 16 recent errors and 2 critical ones, with 2 related startup errors. That suggests this might be a recurring issue, maybe after a deployment or environment change.\n\nImmediate action should be to check if the dexter_brain module exists in the project directory. If it's a local package, maybe it's not in the right location or not included in the Python path. The user should verify the file structure. If it's a third-party package, they might need to install it via pip. But since the name is 'dexter_brain', it could be a custom module specific to the project. So checking the project structure and ensuring that the module is present and properly imported is key.\n\nFor a permanent fix, if the module is part of the project, they should make sure it's included in the source control and deployed correctly. If it's a third-party package, adding it to the requirements.txt and installing dependencies would help. Also, setting up a virtual environment and ensuring that the environment is activated when running the application could prevent such issues.\n\nPrevention would involve adding checks in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure all dependencies are installed and the environment is correctly configured. Maybe adding a pre-start script that verifies the presence of necessary modules. Also, implementing logging to catch import errors early and alerting on startup failures.\n\nRisk assessment: The immediate action of checking the file structure and installing dependencies is low risk. The permanent fix of adjusting the environment or project structure might have medium risk if not done carefully, especially if it affects other parts of the system. But since the error is critical, the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nConfidence in this solution is high because ModuleNotFoundError usually points to missing packages or incorrect paths, which are common issues with straightforward fixes.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because Python cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. The module is not installed in the current Python environment  \n2. The module exists but is not in the Python path  \n3. There's a typo/mismatch in the module name  \n\nGiven the context (backend code importing from 'dexter_brain.sandbox'), this appears to be a custom module that should be part of the project but is missing from the environment.  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' exists in the project directory (should be a folder with __init__.py)  \n2. If missing:  \n   a. Restore from version control or retrieve from backup  \n   b. OR Install required package via pip if it's a third-party module (check documentation)  \n3. If present but not recognized:  \n   a. Check PYTHONPATH environment variable includes the project root  \n   b. Run `python -m sys path` to verify module search paths  \n4. Create virtual environment and install dependencies:  \n   ```bash  \n   python -m venv venv  \n   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate  \n   pip install -r requirements.txt  \n   ```  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. Ensure 'dexter_brain' is properly included in version control  \n2. Add explicit installation instructions in documentation  \n3. Modify startup script to validate critical dependencies:  \n   ```python  \n   try:  \n       import dexter_brain  \n   except ImportError:  \n       raise RuntimeError(\"Missing required module: dexter_brain. Install dependencies first.\")  \n   ```  \n4. Implement dependency management:  \n   - Add 'dexter_brain' to requirements.txt if it's a package  \n   - OR Use setuptools to package it as part of the application  \n\nPrevention:  \n1. Add pre-deployment check:  \n   ```bash  \n   # In CI/CD pipeline  \n   python -c \"import dexter_brain\" || exit 1  \n   ```  \n2. Monitor import errors in logs with alerting  \n3. Use pip-check (or similar tool) to verify dependencies  \n4. Standardize environment setup with Docker containers  \n\nRisk_Level: LOW  \nConfidence: HIGH  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
