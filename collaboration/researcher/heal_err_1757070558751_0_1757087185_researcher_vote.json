  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a ModuleNotFoundError for 'dexter_brain' when starting up their system. The error is critical and happening during startup, which means the system can't initialize properly.\n\nFirst, root cause. The error message says 'No module named 'dexter_brain'', so the Python interpreter can't find that module. That usually means the module isn't installed, or it's not in the right directory. Since the error is in the startup_event function in main.py, the code is trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox, but it's missing.\n\nImmediate action: They need to check if the module exists. Maybe it's not installed. If it's a package, they should install it using pip. If it's a local module, the directory structure might be wrong, so adding the path could help. Alternatively, a virtual environment might not be activated, so checking that is important.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure the module is properly installed in the environment. If it's a third-party package, add it to requirements.txt. If it's a local module, make sure it's in the correct location and the Python path includes it. Maybe the project structure changed, so checking the file paths and imports is necessary.\n\nPrevention: Set up monitoring to check for missing modules during deployment. Use linters or tools like pyflakes to catch import errors before deployment. Also, ensure that the environment is correctly set up with all dependencies, maybe using a Docker container to standardize environments.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing module is low if it's a known package. However, if the module isn't supposed to be there, there might be a deeper issue. Also, modifying the Python path could have unintended consequences if not done carefully. But overall, the risk is medium because it's a common issue with straightforward solutions.\n\nConfidence: High, because this is a typical Python import error with standard fixes. The steps to install the module or adjust the path are well-established.\n\nSo putting it all together, the analysis would point to the missing module. Immediate actions involve checking installation and paths. Permanent fix is ensuring the module is correctly installed or structured. Prevention through better dependency management and testing. Risk is medium, confidence high.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. The module is installed but not in a directory included in the `PYTHONPATH`.  \n3. The module is a local file, but its path is incorrect or misconfigured.  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. **Check if `dexter_brain` is a third-party package**: Run `pip install dexter_brain` (if applicable).  \n2. **Verify local module structure**: Ensure `dexter_brain` is a directory in the project root with an `__init__.py` file.  \n3. **Activate virtual environment**: If using a venv, ensure it is activated (`source venv/bin/activate` or `venv\\Scripts\\activate`).  \n4. **Add path manually (temporary)**: In `main.py`, add `import sys; sys.path.append(\"path/to/dexter_brain\")` before the import.  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. **Install missing dependency**: If `dexter_brain` is a package, add it to `requirements.txt` and install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  \n2. **Adjust project structure**: Ensure `dexter_brain` is in the same directory as `main.py` or a subdirectory listed in `PYTHONPATH`.  \n3. **Use relative imports**: If `dexter_brain` is part of the same project, refactor imports to use relative paths (e.g., `from .sandbox import create_sandbox` if in the same package).  \n\nPrevention:  \n1. **Automate dependency checks**: Use `pip check` in CI/CD pipelines to validate installed packages.  \n2. **Standardize environments**: Use Docker containers or `pipenv` to ensure consistent environments.  \n3. **Add pre-startup validation**: Write a script to verify critical modules are importable before launching the app.  \n\nRisk_Level: MEDIUM (Modifying paths or installing packages could introduce conflicts, but risks are manageable with testing.)  \nConfidence: HIGH (This is a common Python import error with well-documented solutions.)  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
