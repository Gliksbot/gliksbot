  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a ModuleNotFoundError for 'dexter_brain' when starting up the system. The error is a startup error, critical severity, and it's happening during the import in main.py line 120.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out why Python can't find the dexter_brain module. Common reasons for this are missing installations, incorrect import paths, or issues with the Python environment.\n\nLooking at the stack trace, the code is trying to import from 'dexter_brain.sandbox' in main.py. The error says the module isn't found. So, the first thought is that the dexter_brain package isn't installed in the current Python environment. Alternatively, maybe the package is installed but not in the right location, or there's a typo in the import statement.\n\nBut the error message is 'No module named 'dexter_brain'', which suggests that the package isn't installed. However, sometimes even if it's installed, the Python path might not include the directory where it's located. So possible root causes are:\n\n1. The dexter_brain package isn't installed in the environment.\n2. The package is installed but in a different environment or directory not on the Python path.\n3. There's a typo in the module name in the import statement.\n4. The package structure is incorrect, maybe missing __init__.py files.\n\nSince the context isn't available, I can't check the environment setup. But assuming that the code is correct (i.e., the import is correct), the most likely issue is that the package isn't installed.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if the package is installed. If not, install it. But how? The user might need to install it via pip, or maybe it's a local package that needs to be added to the path.\n\nWait, the error is in the system source, so maybe this is part of a larger application where dexter_brain is a dependency. If the system is supposed to have this module, perhaps it's missing from the deployment environment.\n\nFor the immediate action, the user should verify the installation of dexter_brain. If it's a third-party package, install it using pip. If it's a local module, ensure that the directory containing dexter_brain is in the Python path.\n\nBut since the error is during startup, maybe the virtual environment isn't activated, or the dependencies weren't installed properly. So steps could include checking the environment, installing dependencies, or adding the module's path.\n\nFor a permanent fix, ensuring that the package is included in the project's dependencies, so that it's installed automatically during deployment. If it's a local module, making sure it's part of the project structure and included in the Python path.\n\nPrevention could involve adding checks during the startup to verify that all required modules are present, or using dependency management tools to ensure all packages are installed. Also, setting up proper CI/CD pipelines to test installations.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing package might be low if it's a known dependency. However, if the package has dependencies that conflict with existing ones, that could cause issues. Alternatively, modifying the Python path might have unintended consequences if not done carefully.\n\nSo putting this all together, the root cause is likely that the dexter_brain module isn't installed or not in the Python path. Immediate action is to install it or adjust the path. Permanent fix is to ensure it's part of the project's dependencies. Prevention through dependency management and checks. Risk is low to medium depending on the environment.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because the Python interpreter cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. The module is not installed in the current Python environment  \n2. The module is installed but not in the Python path  \n3. The module exists but has an incorrect structure (missing __init__.py or incorrect naming)  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' is a local module or third-party package  \n2. If third-party: Run `pip install dexter_brain` (or `pip3` depending on environment)  \n3. If local:  \n   a. Confirm the module directory exists in the project root  \n   b. Add the root directory to PYTHONPATH:  \n      ```bash  \n      export PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:/M/gliksbot\"  \n      ```  \n   c. Verify module structure contains `__init__.py` files  \n4. Retry startup  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. For third-party packages:  \n   - Add 'dexter_brain' to requirements.txt  \n   - Implement automated dependency installation in deployment pipeline  \n2. For local modules:  \n   - Ensure module directory is included in the project's root  \n   - Add explicit path configuration in main.py (if necessary):  \n     ```python  \n     import sys  \n     sys.path.append(\"/M/gliksbot\")  \n     ```  \n   - Create setup.py to package internal modules properly  \n\nPrevention:  \n1. Implement dependency validation during CI/CD pipeline  \n2. Add pre-startup check script to verify critical modules exist  \n3. Use virtual environments with pinned dependencies  \n4. Monitor for ModuleNotFoundError patterns in logs  \n\nRisk_Level: LOW  \nConfidence: HIGH  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
