  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a ModuleNotFoundError for 'dexter_brain' when starting up their system. The error is critical and happening during startup, which means the system can't initialize properly.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out why Python can't find the 'dexter_brain' module. Common reasons for this are the module not being installed, not being in the right directory, or there being an issue with the Python path. Since the error occurs during startup, it's likely that the module is either missing or not properly imported.\n\nLooking at the stack trace, the error happens in main.py line 120 when trying to import from 'dexter_brain.sandbox'. The system is trying to create a sandbox, which suggests that 'dexter_brain' is a custom module or package that's part of the project. If it's a third-party package, maybe it wasn't installed. But since the name is specific, it might be a local package.\n\nImmediate actions would be to check if 'dexter_brain' is installed. If it's a local package, maybe the directory structure is incorrect. The user should verify that the package is in the Python path. They can check by running 'python -c \"import dexter_brain\"' to see if it imports. If not, they need to ensure the package is installed or the path is set correctly.\n\nFor a permanent fix, if 'dexter_brain' is a dependency, installing it via pip would solve it. If it's a local package, they might need to adjust the sys.path to include the directory where 'dexter_brain' is located. Alternatively, using a virtual environment where the package is installed could help. Also, checking the __init__.py files in the package directories to ensure they're present and correct.\n\nPrevention would involve setting up proper dependency management, like a requirements.txt file, and ensuring that the environment is correctly set up for deployments. Monitoring could include checking for missing modules during startup and having alerts for such errors. Code reviews to ensure all imports are correctly referenced and part of the project's dependencies.\n\nRisks of the solutions: If the module is supposed to be there but isn't, installing it might be safe. However, if there's a version mismatch, that could cause other issues. Adjusting the Python path might lead to other modules being shadowed or not found if not done carefully. So the risk level might be medium.\n\nConfidence in the solution depends on knowing whether 'dexter_brain' is a third-party or local package. If the user can confirm that, the solution would be more accurate. But based on the info given, assuming it's a missing package or path issue, the steps should help.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because the Python interpreter cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. The module is not installed in the current Python environment  \n2. The module's directory is not in the Python path  \n3. The module file is missing or misnamed  \n\nThe stack trace shows the import attempt in `main.py` line 120, indicating the system expects 'dexter_brain' to be available as a package. Given the error context (system startup), this is likely a critical dependency for the application.\n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' is a local package or third-party dependency  \n2. If local:  \n   - Check if the directory containing `dexter_brain/__init__.py` exists in the project root  \n   - Add the project root to PYTHONPATH:  \n     ```bash  \n     export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/gliksbot/backend:$PYTHONPATH  \n     ```  \n3. If third-party:  \n   - Install the package (if available):  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install dexter-brain  # or appropriate package name  \n     ```  \n4. Test import in Python shell:  \n   ```python  \n   python -c \"import dexter_brain\"  \n   ```\n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. If local package:  \n   - Ensure proper package structure with `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`  \n   - Install package in development mode:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install -e /path/to/gliksbot  \n     ```  \n2. If third-party:  \n   - Add dependency to `requirements.txt`  \n   - Implement environment consistency checks (e.g., `pip-compile` workflow)  \n3. Modify code to include absolute import fallbacks if needed\n\nPrevention:  \n- Add pre-startup check script to validate critical imports  \n- Implement CI/CD pipeline checks for module availability  \n- Use virtual environments with pinned dependencies  \n- Monitor Python path configuration in production deployments\n\nRisk_Level: MEDIUM  \n(Incorrect path modifications could cause other import issues; dependency installation might introduce version conflicts)\n\nConfidence: HIGH  \n(Based on standard Python module resolution patterns and typical deployment configurations)\n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
