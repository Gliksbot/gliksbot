  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to parse through it carefully. The error is a STARTUP_ERROR with the message \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". The stack trace points to line 120 in main.py trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nFirst, the root cause. The error is a ModuleNotFoundError, which typically means that the Python interpreter can't find the specified module. So, either the module isn't installed, not in the right directory, or there's a typo in the import statement. Since the error occurs during startup, it's likely that the dexter_brain package isn't installed in the environment where the application is running. Alternatively, the package might be installed but not in the Python path.\n\nLooking at the system status, there are recent errors and critical errors, but the context isn't available. The source is the system itself, so maybe the environment setup is incorrect. The error ID and timestamp are recent, so this might be a new issue.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if the dexter_brain module exists in the project directory or if it's a third-party package that needs installation. If it's a local module, ensuring it's in the right location and that the Python path includes it. If it's a package, installing it via pip or the appropriate package manager.\n\nFor a permanent fix, the solution would involve ensuring that the module is properly installed and accessible. If it's a dependency, adding it to the requirements.txt or similar file. If it's a local package, making sure it's included in the project structure and that the imports are correct.\n\nPrevention would involve setting up proper dependency management, using virtual environments, and maybe implementing checks during deployment to ensure all required modules are present. Also, monitoring for missing modules during startup could help catch such errors early.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing package is low if it's a known dependency. However, if the package isn't maintained or has security issues, that could be a problem. Also, modifying the Python path might have unintended consequences if not done carefully.\n\nNow, considering the special considerations: the solution shouldn't disrupt ongoing operations. Since the system is in healing mode, maybe the fix can be applied without restarting the entire system, but if it's a startup error, a restart might be necessary after fixing the environment.\n\nThe user wants specific implementation steps. So, for immediate action, check the file system for dexter_brain, check installed packages, install if missing. For permanent fix, ensure it's in requirements.txt. Prevention could involve automated checks.\n\nI should structure the response into Analysis, Approach, and Implementation as per the user's request. Also, check if any new skills are needed, but in this case, it's standard Python troubleshooting, so probably not. But if the system requires specific tools, maybe a skill spec would be needed, but I don't think so here.\n\nWait, the error is in the backend main.py, so the code is trying to import a module that's not present. The user might have forgotten to include the package in the deployment environment. So steps would be to install the package, or if it's a local module, ensure it's in the right place.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAnalysis: The error is due to the absence of the dexter_brain module in the Python environment. Possible causes include missing installation, incorrect import path, or environment misconfiguration.\n\nImmediate Action: Check if dexter_brain is installed, install it if necessary, or verify its location and adjust sys.path if needed.\n\nPermanent Fix: Add the module to the project's dependencies, ensure it's included in the deployment package, or install it in the environment.\n\nPrevention: Use dependency management tools, implement pre-startup checks for required modules.\n\nRisk Level: Low, as installing a missing package is straightforward, but depends on the package's availability and compatibility.\n\nConfidence: High, since the error is a common Python issue with straightforward solutions.\n\nI need to make sure the steps are concrete. For example, using pip install, checking the directory structure, modifying sys.path temporarily, etc.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This typically occurs due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in a directory included in the `PYTHONPATH` or project structure.  \n3. **Environment Misconfiguration**: The application is running in an incorrect or corrupted virtual environment.  \n\n**Contextual Factors**:  \n- The error occurs at startup, suggesting a dependency missing in the deployment environment.  \n- No context is available, implying potential gaps in deployment logs or environment setup documentation.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Immediate Action**:  \n   - Verify the presence of `dexter_brain` in the environment.  \n   - Install the module if missing or adjust paths to include it.  \n2. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Ensure `dexter_brain` is explicitly listed as a dependency.  \n   - Validate environment setup and deployment pipelines.  \n3. **Prevention**:  \n   - Implement dependency checks during deployment.  \n   - Use version-controlled environments (e.g., `requirements.txt`).  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### **Immediate Action**  \n1. **Check Installed Packages**:  \n   Run `pip list | grep dexter_brain` (or `pip freeze`) in the environment where the application runs.  \n   - If missing, proceed to install.  \n\n2. **Install the Module**:  \n   - If `dexter_brain` is a third-party package:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install dexter_brain  \n     ```  \n   - If it’s a local/internal module:  \n     - Ensure the directory containing `dexter_brain` is in the project root or a path included in `PYTHONPATH`.  \n     - Alternatively, symlink the module to the project directory.  \n\n3. **Verify Path Inclusion**:  \n   Temporarily modify `main.py` to print `sys.path` before the failing import to confirm the module’s directory is included.  \n\n#### **Permanent Fix**  \n1. **Add to Dependencies**:  \n   - If `dexter_brain` is a third-party package, add it to `requirements.txt`:  \n     ```  \n     dexter_brain==<version>  \n     ```  \n   - If it’s a local module, ensure it’s included in the project repository and referenced correctly in the codebase.  \n\n2. **Environment Validation**:  \n   - Use a virtual environment (e.g., `venv`) and ensure it’s activated during deployment.  \n   - Automate environment setup with a script (e.g., `setup.sh`):  \n     ```bash  \n     python -m venv venv  \n     source venv/bin/activate  \n     pip install -r requirements.txt  \n     ```  \n\n#### **Prevention**  \n1. **Pre-Startup Checks**:  \n   Add a script to validate required modules before starting the application:  \n   ```python  \n   # check_dependencies.py  \n   try:  \n       import dexter_brain  \n   except ImportError:  \n       raise RuntimeError(\"Missing dependency: dexter_brain\")  \n   ```  \n   Run this script as part of the deployment process.  \n\n2. **Monitoring**:  \n   - Set up alerts for `ModuleNotFoundError` in logs.  \n   - Use tools like `sentry` or `datadog` to track startup failures.  \n\n---\n\n### Risk Assessment  \n- **Risk Level**: **LOW**  \n  - Installing a missing package is low-risk if the module is trusted and version-controlled.  \n  - Path adjustments are temporary and reversible.  \n- **Confidence**: **HIGH**  \n  - The solution addresses the most common causes of `ModuleNotFoundError` with minimal disruption.  \n\n---\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (If Required)  \nIf the team lacks Python environment management skills, define a skill specification for dependency management:  \n```json  \n{  \n  \"skill\": \"Python Dependency Management\",  \n  \"description\": \"Ability to install, version, and validate Python packages in development and production environments.\",  \n  \"tools\": [\"pip\", \"venv\", \"requirements.txt\"],  \n  \"resources\": [\"Python Packaging User Guide\"]  \n}  \n```  \n\nThis approach balances rapid resolution with long-term stability, ensuring minimal downtime and preventing recurrence."
