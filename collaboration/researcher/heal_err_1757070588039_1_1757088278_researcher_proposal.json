  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That's a Python error when a module isn't found. The traceback shows it's happening in main.py line 120 during the startup_event. The error type is STARTUP_ERROR, which means the system couldn't start properly because of this missing module.\n\nLooking at the context, there's no context available, which might mean that the error occurred before any context could be logged. The system status shows multiple recent and critical errors, but the related startup errors are two. So this might be a recurring issue.\n\nThe mission is to diagnose and provide solutions. The analysis required has five parts: root cause, immediate action, permanent fix, prevention, and risk assessment.\n\nRoot cause: The error is a ModuleNotFoundError for 'dexter_brain'. That usually means the module isn't installed, not in the Python path, or there's a typo in the import. Since the error is during startup, maybe the module isn't installed in the environment where the code is running. Alternatively, the module might be missing from the project structure, or there's an issue with the virtual environment.\n\nImmediate action: The user needs to check if the module is installed. If it's a third-party module, installing it via pip. If it's a local module, ensuring it's in the right directory and the Python path includes it. Alternatively, restarting the service or checking environment variables.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensuring that the module is properly included in the project's dependencies. If it's a local module, making sure the directory is in the PYTHONPATH. If it's a package, adding it to requirements.txt and ensuring it's installed in the correct environment. Also, checking for any typos in the import statement.\n\nPrevention: Implementing checks during deployment to ensure all dependencies are installed. Using virtual environments to isolate dependencies. Adding monitoring to check for missing modules during startup. Maybe integrating a linter or a script that checks for missing imports before deployment.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing module could be low if it's a known dependency. However, if the module has dependencies of its own, there might be compatibility issues. Also, if the module isn't supposed to be there, installing it might introduce security risks. So the risk level would be medium, depending on the module's origin.\n\nNow, considering the system source is 'system', which might refer to the core system components. The error is critical, so it's blocking the system from starting. The user needs to act quickly but carefully.\n\nFor the implementation steps, the immediate action would be to check the Python environment, install the module if necessary, and restart the service. The permanent fix would involve updating the project's dependencies and ensuring the environment is correctly configured. Prevention could involve adding automated checks and monitoring.\n\nI should also check if 'dexter_brain' is a custom module or a third-party one. If it's custom, maybe it's missing from the repository or not properly linked. If it's third-party, the package name might be different. For example, sometimes the import name differs from the package name. Like 'import pandas' but installed as 'pandas'. So the user should verify the correct package name.\n\nIn the code, the import is 'from dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox'. So the module is 'dexter_brain', which might be a local package. If that's the case, the directory containing dexter_brain's __init__.py should be in the Python path. The user should check if that directory exists and is included in the environment.\n\nSo possible steps: Check if the dexter_brain directory exists in the project, ensure it's in the right location, and that the Python path includes it. Alternatively, if it's a package that needs to be installed, install it.\n\nIf the user is using a virtual environment, they should activate it and check installed packages. If not, maybe the global environment is missing the package.\n\nIn terms of code, maybe adding the directory to sys.path in main.py as a temporary fix, but that's not ideal for production. Better to structure the project so that the module is in the correct location.\n\nSo putting this all together into the required sections.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., directory structure issues).  \n3. **Typo/Case Sensitivity**: A typo in the module name or case mismatch (e.g., `Dexter_Brain` vs. `dexter_brain`).  \n4. **Environment Misconfiguration**: The virtual environment is not activated, or dependencies are not properly installed.  \n\n**Context**:  \n- The error occurs during startup (`startup_event`), blocking system initialization.  \n- No context is available, suggesting the error happens early in the bootstrapping process.  \n- The system has experienced 2 related `STARTUP_ERROR` errors, indicating a recurring issue.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Immediate Action**:  \n   - Verify the existence and location of the `dexter_brain` module.  \n   - Ensure the correct Python environment is activated and dependencies are installed.  \n   - Temporarily modify the Python path if the module is locally available but not recognized.  \n\n2. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Integrate the `dexter_brain` module into the project’s dependency management (e.g., `requirements.txt`).  \n   - Ensure the module is installed in the correct environment and its directory is in the Python path.  \n   - Validate module naming and case sensitivity.  \n\n3. **Prevention**:  \n   - Implement automated dependency checks during deployment.  \n   - Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies.  \n   - Add monitoring for missing modules during startup.  \n\n4. **Risk Assessment**:  \n   - **Risk Level**: MEDIUM (Installing unknown modules could introduce compatibility or security risks, but the error is critical and requires resolution).  \n   - **Confidence**: HIGH (The solution addresses common causes of `ModuleNotFoundError`).  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### **Immediate Action**  \n1. **Check Module Installation**:  \n   ```bash  \n   # Check installed packages  \n   pip list | grep dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If not found, install it (if it’s a third-party package):  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n\n2. **Verify Module Location**:  \n   - Locate the `dexter_brain` directory (should contain `__init__.py`).  \n   - Ensure it is in the project root or a directory included in the Python path.  \n\n3. **Temporarily Add to Python Path (if needed)**:  \n   Modify `main.py` to add the module’s directory to `sys.path`:  \n   ```python  \n   import sys  \n   import os  \n   sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(\"path/to/dexter_brain\"))  \n   ```  \n\n4. **Restart the Service**:  \n   ```bash  \n   # Example for a service managed by systemd  \n   sudo systemctl restart gliksbot  \n   ```  \n\n---\n\n#### **Permanent Fix**  \n1. **Update Dependency Management**:  \n   - If `dexter_brain` is a third-party package, add it to `requirements.txt`:  \n     ```txt  \n     dexter_brain==<version>  \n     ```  \n   - If it’s a local module, ensure it is included in the project repository and installed in \"editable\" mode:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install -e .  \n     ```  \n\n2. **Environment Configuration**:  \n   - Use a virtual environment and ensure it is activated during deployment:  \n     ```bash  \n     python -m venv venv  \n     source venv/bin/activate  \n     pip install -r requirements.txt  \n     ```  \n\n3. **Validate Module Naming**:  \n   - Confirm the module name matches exactly (case-sensitive).  \n   - Check for typos in the import statement:  \n     ```python  \n     # Correct  \n     from dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox  \n     ```  \n\n---\n\n#### **Prevention**  \n1. **Automated Dependency Checks**:  \n   Add a pre-startup script to validate dependencies:  \n   ```bash  \n   # check_dependencies.sh  \n   python -c \"import dexter_brain\" || { echo \"Missing module: dexter_brain\"; exit 1; }  \n   ```  \n\n2. **Monitoring**:  \n   - Use tools like Prometheus or custom logging to track startup errors.  \n   - Set up alerts for `ModuleNotFoundError` in logs.  \n\n3. **Code Quality**:  \n   - Integrate a linter (e.g., `pylint`, `flake8`) to catch missing imports during development.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Risk Assessment**  \n- **Risk of Immediate Action**: LOW (Temporary path modification is reversible; installing known packages is safe).  \n- **Risk of Permanent Fix**: MEDIUM (Dependency updates could introduce conflicts, but this is mitigated by version pinning in `requirements.txt`).  \n\n---\n\n**Collaboration Note**:  \nThis proposal balances urgency and safety. The immediate steps resolve the critical error, while the permanent fix ensures long-term stability. The team should validate the module’s origin (third-party vs. local) before proceeding with installation."
