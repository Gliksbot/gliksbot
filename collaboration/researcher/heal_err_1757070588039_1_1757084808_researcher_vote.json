  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a ModuleNotFoundError for 'dexter_brain' when starting up the system. The error is critical and happening during startup, which means the system can't initialize properly.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out why Python can't find the 'dexter_brain' module. Common reasons for this are missing installations, incorrect import paths, or environment issues. Since the error is in the startup_event function in main.py, the code is trying to import from 'dexter_brain.sandbox' but it's not found.\n\nLooking at the context, there's no context available, so maybe the environment where the code is running doesn't have the 'dexter_brain' package installed. Alternatively, the package might be installed in a different Python environment, or the module isn't structured correctly.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if 'dexter_brain' is installed. If not, install it. But since the user might not have it, maybe it's a local module that's missing. If it's a third-party package, using pip install would work. But if it's a custom module, the directory structure might be wrong, or the Python path isn't set correctly.\n\nFor a permanent fix, ensuring that the module is properly installed in the environment, or adding the correct path to the Python path in the code. Also, checking the requirements.txt or setup.py to include the necessary dependencies.\n\nPrevention could involve setting up a virtual environment with all dependencies specified, using tools like pipenv or conda to manage environments, and adding checks during deployment to ensure all modules are present.\n\nRisk assessment: If installing a package, there might be version conflicts. If modifying the Python path, it could lead to other issues if not done correctly. So the risk level might be medium.\n\nConfidence in the solution depends on whether 'dexter_brain' is a known package or a custom one. If it's a typo, correcting the import would be better. But given the info, assuming it's a missing package.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because Python cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to either:  \n1. Missing installation of the 'dexter_brain' package in the current Python environment  \n2. Incorrect Python path configuration preventing the interpreter from finding the module  \n3. A typo or incorrect import statement in the code  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' is a third-party package:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If this fails, check if it's a local/custom module.  \n2. If local module:  \n   - Confirm the module exists in the project directory (e.g., `M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\dexter_brain`)  \n   - Ensure `dexter_brain` is at the same level as `main.py` or add its path to `PYTHONPATH`:  \n     ```bash  \n     set PYTHONPATH=M:\\gliksbot\\backend  \n     ```  \n3. Test import in a Python shell:  \n   ```python  \n   import dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. If 'dexter_brain' is a dependency:  \n   - Add it to `requirements.txt`  \n   - Ensure it's installed in the deployment environment  \n2. If local module:  \n   - Structure the project to include `dexter_brain` in the root directory  \n   - Use relative imports if appropriate (e.g., `from .dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox`)  \n   - Add `__init__.py` files to make directories Python packages  \n\nPrevention:  \n- Implement dependency management (e.g., `pipenv`, `poetry`)  \n- Add pre-startup checks to validate module availability  \n- Use CI/CD pipelines to test imports during deployment  \n- Monitor for `ModuleNotFoundError` in logs with alerts  \n\nRisk_Level: MEDIUM  \n- Risk of version conflicts if installing third-party packages  \n- Path modifications could introduce environment-specific issues  \n\nConfidence: HIGH  \n- Solution addresses common causes of missing module errors  \n- Steps are standard Python troubleshooting practices  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
