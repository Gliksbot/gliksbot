  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The stack trace shows the import happens in main.py line 120. So the immediate issue is the missing module.\n\nRoot cause: The 'dexter_brain' module isn't installed or not in the Python path. Maybe it's a custom module that's missing from the environment, or perhaps it's supposed to be in a specific directory that's not included in the sys.path.\n\nImmediate action: Check if the module exists in the project directory. If it's a package, maybe it needs to be installed. If it's a local module, the import might be incorrect. The user could try installing it via pip if it's a third-party package, or adjust the import path if it's a local file.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure the module is properly installed or linked. If it's part of the project, maybe the directory containing 'dexter_brain' should be added to the Python path. Alternatively, if it's a package, installing it with pip. Also, checking the project structure to make sure the module is in the right place.\n\nPrevention: Implement checks during deployment to ensure all required modules are present. Use requirements.txt to list dependencies, and maybe set up a CI/CD pipeline that runs tests to catch missing modules before deployment. Also, monitoring for import errors in the logs.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a new package might be medium if it's not well-maintained, but if it's a local module, the risk is lower. Adjusting the Python path could have risks if it's done incorrectly, but it's generally safe if done properly.\n\nConfidence: High, because the error is straightforward. The solution depends on the exact setup, but the steps are standard for Python import issues.\n\nNow, structuring the answer according to the required format. Need to make sure each section is addressed clearly. For immediate action, specific steps like checking the module's presence, installing if necessary, or adjusting the path. Permanent fix would involve ensuring the module is correctly installed or structured. Prevention could include dependency management and testing. Risk level would be medium if installing a package, but low if it's a local module. Confidence is high.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because Python cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. The module is not installed in the Python environment  \n2. The module's directory is not in the system's PYTHONPATH  \n3. The module file is misnamed or misplaced in the project structure  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' is a local module: Check if the directory containing `dexter_brain/__init__.py` exists in the project root or a subdirectory.  \n2. If missing, restore from backup or version control.  \n3. If present but not recognized, temporarily add its path to sys.path in main.py before the import:  \n   ```python  \n   import sys  \n   sys.path.append(\"M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\path_to_dexter_brain_directory\")  \n   ```  \n4. If it's a package, install via pip:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter-brain  # or specific version if required  \n   ```  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. **For local modules**:  \n   - Ensure the module directory is at the same level as main.py or in a subdirectory included in the project structure.  \n   - Use relative imports if appropriate.  \n2. **For external packages**:  \n   - Add to requirements.txt:  \n     ```  \n     dexter-brain==x.y.z  # specify version if needed  \n     ```  \n   - Install in the correct environment:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install -r requirements.txt  \n     ```  \n3. **For path issues**:  \n   - Set PYTHONPATH environment variable:  \n     ```bash  \n     set PYTHONPATH=M:\\gliksbot\\backend;%PYTHONPATH%  # Windows  \n     export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/gliksbot/backend:$PYTHONPATH  # Linux/macOS  \n     ```  \n\nPrevention:  \n- Add a pre-startup check script to verify critical modules exist.  \n- Use virtual environments with pinned dependencies.  \n- Implement CI/CD pipeline steps to validate imports during testing.  \n- Monitor for ModuleNotFoundError in logs with alerts.  \n\nRisk_Level: MEDIUM (Temporary path modifications could introduce instability if not cleaned up; package installation might have version conflicts)  \n\nConfidence: HIGH (Standard Python import resolution patterns apply)  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
