  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to parse through it carefully. The main issue here is a \"maximum recursion depth exceeded\" error during a healing session. The stack trace shows a loop between log_error and _detect_patterns methods in the error_tracker.py file. \n\nFirst, I should figure out why there's infinite recursion. The error occurs because when an error is logged, it triggers pattern detection, which in turn logs another error, creating a loop. This probably happens when the error being logged is the same as the one being detected, causing the system to keep trying to log and detect it repeatedly.\n\nThe root cause is likely a circular dependency where detecting patterns leads to logging an error that itself requires pattern detection. This creates an infinite loop until the recursion limit is hit. \n\nFor immediate action, I need to stop the recursion. Maybe adding a check to see if the error is already being processed. Like a flag or a set of error IDs that are currently in the detection phase. If an error is already in that set, skip logging it again. That would break the loop.\n\nA permanent fix would involve refactoring the error detection logic to avoid circular calls. Perhaps separating the logging and detection phases so that detecting patterns doesn't trigger another log, which then detects again. Maybe using a different method for logging detected errors that doesn't go through the same path that triggers detection.\n\nPrevention could involve adding monitoring for recursion depth or tracking the call stack to detect potential loops before they happen. Also, unit tests that check for circular dependencies in error handling.\n\nRisks of the immediate action might be that some errors aren't logged if they're part of a loop, but that's better than crashing the system. The permanent fix might require significant code changes, so testing is important.\n\nI should also check the error IDs mentioned. The original error ID is err_1757087886622_179, and the healing session ID is heal_err_... Maybe there's a way to correlate these to see if the same error is being processed multiple times.\n\nIn terms of implementation, adding a decorator or a context manager that tracks active error processing. When log_error is called, it checks if the error is already being handled. If so, it skips further processing. Alternatively, using a thread-local storage or a global set to track active errors.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the error message itself is causing the detection. For example, if the error message contains keywords that trigger the same detection rule, leading to infinite recursion. So, sanitizing the error messages or adjusting the detection patterns to avoid self-triggering.\n\nBut the stack trace shows that _detect_patterns calls log_error, which in turn calls _detect_patterns again. So the detection process is generating a new error that needs logging, which then triggers detection again. This suggests that the detected pattern is considered an error that needs logging, which then gets detected again.\n\nSo the fix would be to ensure that when a pattern is detected, the resulting log doesn't trigger the same detection. Maybe by having a different logging path for detected errors that bypasses the pattern detection, or by marking the error as already processed.\n\nIn code terms, perhaps adding a parameter to log_error indicating whether it's a detected error, and in _detect_patterns, when logging, pass that parameter so that it doesn't re-trigger detection.\n\nAlternatively, using a try-except block around the detection logic to catch recursion errors and break the loop, but that's more of a band-aid.\n\nThe best approach is to restructure the code to avoid the circular dependency. For example, when detecting patterns, instead of logging a new error (which triggers detection again), maybe just record the detected pattern in the original error without creating a new error entry. Or have a separate method for logging detected errors that doesn't invoke pattern detection.\n\nFor the immediate action, adding a check in log_error to see if the error's stack trace already contains the _detect_patterns frame, and if so, abort. But that might be complex. Alternatively, using a counter to limit the number of recursive calls.\n\nBut the error says \"maximum recursion depth exceeded\", which in Python is usually 1000. The stack trace here shows many repeated calls, so the loop is deep. So the immediate fix would be to prevent the recursion.\n\nIn code:\n\nIn error_tracker.py's log_error method, before calling _detect_patterns, check if we're already in the process of detecting patterns for this error. If yes, return early.\n\nMaybe using a set to track error IDs that are currently being processed. When log_error is called, add the error ID to the set, and in _detect_patterns, check if the error ID is in the set. If it is, skip logging. Then remove it from the set after processing.\n\nBut need to handle concurrency if multiple threads are involved. Using a thread-safe structure.\n\nAlternatively, passing a context parameter that indicates whether detection is already in progress.\n\nFor the permanent fix, redesigning the error handling flow to separate detection and logging phases. For example, first log the error, then detect patterns in a separate step that doesn't trigger logging of new errors. Or have the detection process update the original error with detected patterns instead of creating a new error.\n\nPrevention would involve code reviews to check for such circular dependencies, and adding tests that simulate error logging and detection to ensure no infinite recursion occurs.\n\nRisk assessment: The immediate action might miss some legitimate errors if they are part of a legitimate loop, but given the current issue, it's necessary. The permanent fix could introduce new bugs if not tested properly, so thorough testing is needed.\n\nSo putting it all together in the required format.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error is caused by infinite recursion between `log_error` and `_detect_patterns` methods in `error_tracker.py`. When an error is logged, it triggers pattern detection, which logs another error, creating a loop. This occurs because detecting a pattern generates a new error that itself requires detection, exceeding Python's recursion limit.\n\nImmediate_Action: \n1. **Add Recursion Guard**: Implement a check in `log_error` to detect if the current error is already being processed (e.g., using a thread-safe set to track active error IDs). If so, skip further processing.\n2. **Limit Recursion Depth**: Temporarily reduce the recursion limit (not recommended long-term) or increase the stack size as a stopgap.\n3. **Emergency Patch**: Comment out the `_detect_patterns` call in `log_error` to break the loop immediately (use with caution).\n\nPermanent_Fix: \n1. **Decouple Logging and Detection**: Refactor code to separate error logging and pattern detection into distinct phases. For example:\n   - Log the error first.\n   - Schedule pattern detection as a separate async task that does not trigger new error logging.\n2. **Use Non-Recursive Detection**: Modify `_detect_patterns` to update the original error with detected patterns instead of logging a new error.\n3. **Contextual Logging**: Introduce a `detected_by` flag in the error object to avoid reprocessing the same error in detection loops.\n\nPrevention: \n1. **Code Review**: Enforce checks for circular dependencies in error handling workflows.\n2. **Unit Tests**: Add tests simulating error logging and detection to catch recursion risks.\n3. **Monitoring**: Implement alerts for high recursion depth or repeated `HEALING_FAILED` errors.\n\nRisk_Level: MEDIUM (Immediate action may suppress valid errors; permanent fix requires thorough testing to avoid regressions).\n\nConfidence: HIGH (Root cause is clear; solution aligns with standard recursion prevention patterns).\n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
