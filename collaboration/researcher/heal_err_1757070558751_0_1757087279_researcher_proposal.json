The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The traceback shows it's happening in main.py line 120 during the startup_event. The system is trying to import create_sandbox from dexter_brain.sandbox, but the module isn't found.\n\nLooking at the error type: STARTUP_ERROR, CRITICAL severity. This probably means the system can't start up properly because it's missing this module. The context isn't available, so maybe the environment isn't set up correctly. The system status shows recent errors and critical ones, so this might be part of a larger issue, but the immediate problem is the missing module.\n\nRoot cause analysis: The most common reasons for a ModuleNotFoundError are that the module isn't installed, the Python path isn't set correctly, or there's a typo in the import statement. Since the error is during startup, it's likely that the dexter_brain package isn't installed in the current environment. Alternatively, the package might be installed in a different environment or the PYTHONPATH isn't including the directory where dexter_brain is located.\n\nImmediate action: The user needs to check if the package is installed. They can run pip install dexter_brain or pip3 install dexter_brain. If that's not possible, maybe the package is a local module that's not in the right directory. They should verify the installation and the import path. Also, checking the Python environment to ensure it's the correct one where the package is installed.\n\nPermanent fix: If the package is supposed to be part of the project, it should be included in the requirements.txt or setup.py so that it's installed automatically when deploying. If it's a custom module, ensuring that the directory containing dexter_brain is in the Python path. Maybe setting up a virtual environment with all dependencies properly listed.\n\nPrevention: Implementing dependency management to ensure all required packages are installed. Using virtual environments to isolate project dependencies. Adding checks during deployment to verify that all modules are present. Monitoring for ModuleNotFoundError in logs and setting up alerts.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a new package could be medium if it's not well-maintained or has compatibility issues. But since the system is already trying to use it, it's probably necessary. The risk of changing the Python path might be low if done correctly, but could affect other parts if not.\n\nWait, but the error is in the backend's main.py. So maybe dexter_brain is a local package that's part of the project but not properly installed. In that case, the solution would be to install it in development mode or ensure it's in the right location. Alternatively, the package might be missing from the repository.\n\nAnother angle: The error could be due to a missing __init__.py file in the dexter_brain directory, making Python not recognize it as a package. But the error message says \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\", which suggests that the directory isn't found or not in the path.\n\nSo, steps to check: Verify if dexter_brain exists in the project directory, check the Python path, ensure that the environment is correct. If it's a third-party package, install it. If it's a local package, adjust the path or install it.\n\nIn the immediate action, the user should first check if the package is installed. If not, install it. If it's a local package, maybe the directory structure is incorrect. For example, if main.py is in M:\\gliksbot\\backend, then dexter_brain should be a subdirectory there, or in a parent directory that's included in the path.\n\nAlternatively, the user might need to run the script from the correct directory so that the relative imports work. Or set the PYTHONPATH environment variable to include the path to dexter_brain.\n\nFor the permanent fix, if it's a third-party package, adding it to requirements.txt. If it's a local package, ensuring that the project structure is correct and that the package is properly installed in the environment.\n\nPrevention could involve automated testing that checks for missing modules before deployment, or using tools like pip-check or dependency scanners.\n\nRisk level for the solution: If installing a package, the risk depends on the package's trustworthiness. If adjusting the path, the risk is low if done correctly. Confidence would be high if the solution is straightforward, like installing a missing package.\n\nPutting it all together, the root cause is the absence of the dexter_brain module in the Python environment. Immediate action is to install the package or adjust the path. Permanent fix is to ensure dependencies are managed. Prevention through better dependency tracking and environment setup. Risk is medium if the package has issues, but likely necessary.\n</think>\n\n# Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This typically occurs due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The `dexter_brain` package is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in a directory included in the `PYTHONPATH` or Python's module search path.  \n3. **Environment Misconfiguration**: The project may be using a virtual environment where dependencies are not installed, or the global Python environment is being used instead of the project's environment.  \n\n**Contextual Clues**:  \n- The error occurs in `main.py` during the `startup_event`, suggesting the system relies on `dexter_brain` for initialization.  \n- No context is available, implying potential gaps in deployment or environment setup documentation.  \n\n---\n\n# Approach  \n1. **Immediate Verification**:  \n   - Confirm whether `dexter_brain` is a third-party package or a local/custom module.  \n   - Check if the module is installed in the current environment.  \n   - Validate the Python environment and path configuration.  \n\n2. **Resolution Strategy**:  \n   - If third-party: Install the package via `pip`.  \n   - If local: Ensure the module is in the correct directory and the path is configured.  \n   - Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies.  \n\n3. **Prevention**:  \n   - Implement dependency management (e.g., `requirements.txt`).  \n   - Add automated checks for missing modules during deployment.  \n\n---\n\n# Implementation  \n\n### **Immediate Action**  \n1. **Check Installation**:  \n   Run the following command to verify if `dexter_brain` is installed:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip show dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If not found, proceed to install it.  \n\n2. **Install the Module**:  \n   - If `dexter_brain` is a third-party package:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install dexter_brain  \n     ```  \n   - If it’s a local module:  \n     Ensure the directory containing `dexter_brain` is in the project root or add it to `PYTHONPATH`:  \n     ```bash  \n     set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;M:\\gliksbot\\  # Windows  \n     export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/gliksbot  # Linux/macOS  \n     ```  \n\n3. **Verify Environment**:  \n   Ensure the correct Python environment is active (e.g., virtual environment):  \n   ```bash  \n   which python  # Linux/macOS  \n   where python  # Windows  \n   ```  \n\n---\n\n### **Permanent Fix**  \n1. **Dependency Management**:  \n   - Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt`:  \n     ```txt  \n     dexter_brain==<version>  # Specify version if applicable  \n     ```  \n   - Install dependencies during deployment:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install -r requirements.txt  \n     ```  \n\n2. **Project Structure**:  \n   If `dexter_brain` is a local module, ensure it is placed in the project directory (e.g., `M:\\gliksbot\\`) and includes an `__init__.py` file.  \n\n3. **Virtual Environment**:  \n   Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:  \n   ```bash  \n   python -m venv venv  \n   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS  \n   venv\\Scripts\\activate  # Windows  \n   pip install -r requirements.txt  \n   ```  \n\n---\n\n### **Prevention**  \n1. **Automated Checks**:  \n   Add a pre-startup script to validate dependencies:  \n   ```python  \n   # check_dependencies.py  \n   import importlib.util  \n   required_modules = [\"dexter_brain\"]  \n   for module in required_modules:  \n       if not importlib.util.find_spec(module):  \n           raise ModuleNotFoundError(f\"Missing module: {module}\")  \n   ```  \n   Run this script before starting the application.  \n\n2. **Monitoring**:  \n   - Log `ModuleNotFoundError` exceptions and trigger alerts.  \n   - Use tools like `pip-check` to audit dependencies:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install pip-check  \n     pip-check  \n     ```  \n\n---\n\n### **Risk Assessment**  \n- **Risk Level**: **MEDIUM**  \n  Installing third-party packages may introduce compatibility issues, but this is mitigated by version pinning in `requirements.txt`. Adjusting `PYTHONPATH` carries low risk if done temporarily.  \n- **Confidence**: **HIGH**  \n  The solution directly addresses the root cause and aligns with standard Python dependency practices.  \n\n--- \n\n**Collaboration Note**:  \nIf `dexter_brain` is a custom module, share its location and structure for further refinement. If it’s third-party, confirm the package name and version."
