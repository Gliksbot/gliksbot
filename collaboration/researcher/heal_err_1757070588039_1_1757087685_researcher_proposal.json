  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to parse through that first. The error is a STARTUP_ERROR with the message \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". The stack trace points to main.py trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nHmm, the root cause here is likely that the Python module 'dexter_brain' isn't installed or not in the right directory. Since it's a startup error, the system can't start because it's missing this dependency. The immediate action would be to check if the module exists in the environment. If not, install it or add it to the Python path.\n\nLooking at the system status, there are recent errors and critical ones, so this might be part of a larger issue, but the immediate problem is the missing module. For a permanent fix, ensuring that the module is properly installed in the virtual environment or that the project structure includes it. Maybe the module is a local package that wasn't installed correctly.\n\nPrevention could involve adding checks during deployment to verify all dependencies are present, maybe using a requirements.txt file and pip install -r. Also, setting up monitoring to alert if modules are missing during startup.\n\nRisk assessment: The immediate action of installing the module might have a low risk if done correctly, but if the module isn't available, that could be a problem. The permanent fix of modifying the deployment process has medium risk if not tested properly.\n\nI should structure the response with Analysis, Immediate Action, Permanent Fix, Prevention, and Risk. Also, check if the user needs a specific skill or code for implementation. Since it's a Python module issue, maybe a code snippet to check the module or install it. But the user might need to ensure that the module is in the right place. Alternatively, if 'dexter_brain' is a package they developed, they might need to install it in development mode.\n\nWait, the error is in the backend's main.py. So the project structure might have a sibling directory for dexter_brain, or it's a separate package. If it's a local module, the Python path might not include it. So adding the parent directory to PYTHONPATH could help. Alternatively, installing the package using pip install -e . if it's in development.\n\nSo the immediate action could be to check the installation, then install or adjust the path. Permanent fix would be to ensure the deployment process includes installing the module, maybe via a setup.py or requirements file. Prevention would be automated checks and monitoring.\n\nI need to present all this clearly, concisely, and in the required format. Also, check if any new skills are needed. Since it's a standard Python import error, probably no new skills required, but maybe a code example for setting up the environment.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This typically occurs due to:  \n1. Missing installation of the `dexter_brain` package in the current Python environment.  \n2. Incorrect project structure (e.g., `dexter_brain` is not in the Python path).  \n3. A dependency conflict or misconfigured virtual environment.  \n\n**Context**:  \n- The error occurs in `main.py` during the `startup_event`, suggesting `dexter_brain` is a critical dependency for system initialization.  \n- No context is available, so assumptions about the module’s origin (local package, third-party library, or internal tool) must be verified.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Immediate Action**:  \n   - Verify if `dexter_brain` is installed in the current environment.  \n   - If missing, install it via pip or add it to the project’s dependencies.  \n   - If it’s a local module, ensure it is in the correct directory and Python path.  \n\n2. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Integrate `dexter_brain` into the project’s dependency management (e.g., `requirements.txt`).  \n   - Ensure the deployment pipeline includes installing dependencies.  \n   - If `dexter_brain` is a local package, use relative imports or adjust `sys.path` dynamically.  \n\n3. **Prevention**:  \n   - Add pre-startup checks to validate critical dependencies.  \n   - Implement monitoring for missing modules during deployment.  \n   - Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### **Immediate_Action**  \n1. **Check Installation**:  \n   Run in the project’s environment:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip show dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If not found, proceed to install.  \n\n2. **Install or Link the Module**:  \n   - If it’s a third-party package:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install dexter_brain  \n     ```  \n   - If it’s a local package (e.g., in a sibling directory):  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install -e ./path/to/dexter_brain  \n     ```  \n   - Alternatively, temporarily add the directory to `PYTHONPATH`:  \n     ```bash  \n     export PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/dexter_brain\"  \n     ```  \n\n3. **Restart the System**:  \n   ```bash  \n   python main.py  \n   ```  \n\n#### **Permanent_Fix**  \n1. **Update Dependency Management**:  \n   Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt`:  \n   ```  \n   dexter_brain==<version>  # If version-specific  \n   ```  \n   Or, if it’s a local package, use a development egg:  \n   ```  \n   -e ./path/to/dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n\n2. **Modify Deployment Pipeline**:  \n   Ensure the pipeline runs:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install -r requirements.txt  \n   ```  \n\n3. **Adjust Python Path (if local module)**:  \n   In `main.py`, dynamically add the module’s directory:  \n   ```python  \n   import sys  \n   import os  \n   sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(\"../path/to/dexter_brain\"))  \n   ```  \n\n#### **Prevention**  \n1. **Pre-Startup Dependency Check**:  \n   Add a script to validate critical imports before launching:  \n   ```python  \n   # check_dependencies.py  \n   try:  \n       import dexter_brain  \n   except ImportError:  \n       raise RuntimeError(\"Missing dependency: dexter_brain\")  \n   ```  \n   Run this in the startup script.  \n\n2. **Monitoring**:  \n   - Log missing module errors to a centralized system (e.g., Sentry, Datadog).  \n   - Set up alerts for `ModuleNotFoundError` in production.  \n\n---\n\n### Risk Assessment  \n- **Risk_Level**: **LOW** (The proposed fixes involve standard dependency management and path adjustments, which are low-risk if tested.)  \n- **Confidence**: **HIGH** (The error is a common Python issue with well-documented solutions.)  \n\n---\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (If Required)  \n**Skill**: Python Dependency Management  \n**Code**:  \n```python  \n# Example: Dynamic path adjustment for local modules  \nimport sys  \nimport os  \n\n# Add the parent directory of dexter_brain to sys.path  \ndexter_brain_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"..\", \"dexter_brain\"))  \nif dexter_brain_path not in sys.path:  \n    sys.path.append(dexter_brain_path)  \n```  \n\n**Usage**: Place this code at the top of `main.py` or a shared utility module.  \n\n--- \n\nThis approach balances immediate resolution with long-term stability while minimizing disruption."
