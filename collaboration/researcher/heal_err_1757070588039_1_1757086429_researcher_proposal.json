  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The traceback shows it's happening in main.py line 120 during the startup_event. The system is trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox but failing.\n\nLooking at the error type, it's a STARTUP_ERROR of CRITICAL severity. The system has tried once, with two more attempts left. The context isn't available, which might make it harder, but the stack trace gives enough info.\n\nRoot cause analysis: The most likely reason is that the 'dexter_brain' module isn't installed in the Python environment where the backend is running. Alternatively, it might not be in the right directory, or there's a typo in the import statement. Since the error is during startup, it's probably a missing dependency.\n\nImmediate action: The user needs to check if the module exists. They should verify the installation. If it's a local module, maybe the path is incorrect. If it's a package, installing it via pip might help. Also, checking the Python path to ensure the directory containing 'dexter_brain' is included.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure that the module is properly installed and accessible. If it's a third-party package, adding it to requirements.txt. If it's a local module, making sure the project structure is correct and the Python path is set up correctly. Maybe using virtual environments to manage dependencies.\n\nPrevention: Implement dependency checks during deployment, use CI/CD pipelines to test installations, monitor for missing modules, and set up alerts. Also, documenting the dependencies clearly.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing module is low if it's a known package. However, if 'dexter_brain' is a custom module, there might be version compatibility issues. The confidence here is high because this is a common issue with straightforward solutions.\n\nWait, but the error message says 'No module named 'dexter_brain'', which suggests that the package isn't installed. So the immediate action would be to install it. But the user might not have the package available. Alternatively, if it's a local module, the directory structure might be wrong. The implementation steps should include checking the installation, installing if necessary, and verifying the paths.\n\nAlso, considering the system status has recent errors and critical errors, but the main issue here is the missing module. The solution should address that first.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because the Python interpreter can't locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to the module not being installed, not being in the Python path, or a typo in the import statement.\n\nImmediate Action: Check if 'dexter_brain' is installed. If not, install it. If it's a local module, ensure it's in the correct directory and the Python path includes that directory. Restart the service after changes.\n\nPermanent Fix: Ensure the module is included in the project's dependencies. If it's a third-party package, add it to requirements.txt. If it's a local module, structure the project so that the module is in a directory listed in sys.path. Use virtual environments to manage dependencies consistently.\n\nPrevention: Implement automated checks in the deployment pipeline to verify all dependencies are installed. Use linters or tools like pip-check to detect missing modules. Monitor system logs for import errors and set up alerts.\n\nRisk Level: LOW, as installing a missing module is a standard procedure with minimal risk if the correct package is used.\n\nConfidence: HIGH, since this is a common issue with well-established solutions.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in a directory included in the Python path (`sys.path`).  \n3. **Typo/Case Sensitivity**: A typo in the module name or case mismatch (e.g., `Dexter_Brain` vs. `dexter_brain`).  \n\nThe error occurs in `main.py` during the `startup_event`, suggesting the system relies on `dexter_brain` for core functionality. The absence of context and high recent error count (38) implies this may be part of a larger deployment or dependency management issue.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Verify Module Existence**: Confirm whether `dexter_brain` is a local module, third-party package, or custom code.  \n2. **Check Installation**: If it’s a package, install it via `pip`. If local, ensure it’s in the correct directory and Python path.  \n3. **Validate Paths**: Use `sys.path.append()` or environment variables (e.g., `PYTHONPATH`) to include the module’s directory.  \n4. **Automate Dependency Management**: Use `requirements.txt` or a virtual environment to ensure consistent dependencies.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### Immediate_Action  \n1. **Check Installation**:  \n   ```bash  \n   # If 'dexter_brain' is a third-party package:  \n   pip install dexter_brain  \n\n   # If it’s a local module, verify its location:  \n   ls /path/to/project/dexter_brain  # Ensure the directory exists and contains __init__.py  \n   ```  \n\n2. **Add to Python Path (if local)**:  \n   Modify `main.py` to include the module’s directory in `sys.path`:  \n   ```python  \n   import sys  \n   sys.path.append(\"/path/to/project\")  # Add the root directory containing 'dexter_brain'  \n   ```  \n\n3. **Restart Service**:  \n   ```bash  \n   systemctl restart gliksbot-backend  # Or use the appropriate service command  \n   ```  \n\n---\n\n#### Permanent_Fix  \n1. **Dependency Management**:  \n   - If `dexter_brain` is a third-party package, add it to `requirements.txt`:  \n     ```txt  \n     dexter_brain==<version>  \n     ```  \n   - If it’s a local module, structure the project to include it in the root directory and use relative imports.  \n\n2. **Environment Isolation**:  \n   Use a virtual environment to ensure dependencies are isolated and reproducible:  \n   ```bash  \n   python -m venv venv  \n   source venv/bin/activate  \n   pip install -r requirements.txt  \n   ```  \n\n3. **Code Changes**:  \n   Ensure the import statement is correct:  \n   ```python  \n   from dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox  # Verify module name and structure  \n   ```  \n\n---\n\n#### Prevention  \n1. **Automated Dependency Checks**:  \n   Add a pre-startup script to verify all dependencies:  \n   ```bash  \n   # Example: Check for 'dexter_brain' before starting the service  \n   python -c \"import dexter_brain\" || { echo \"Missing module: dexter_brain\"; exit 1; }  \n   ```  \n\n2. **CI/CD Integration**:  \n   Use tools like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to test dependency installation in a clean environment.  \n\n3. **Monitoring**:  \n   Set up alerts for `ModuleNotFoundError` in system logs using tools like Prometheus or Datadog.  \n\n---\n\n#### Risk_Level  \n**LOW**  \n- Installing a missing module is a standard procedure.  \n- Path adjustments are reversible and low-risk if tested in staging first.  \n\n#### Confidence  \n**HIGH**  \n- This is a common Python error with well-documented solutions.  \n- The steps address both installation and path-related root causes.  \n\n--- \n\n### SKILL_SPEC (Optional)  \nIf the team lacks Python dependency management expertise, define a skill specification for onboarding:  \n```json  \n{  \n  \"skill\": \"Python Dependency Management\",  \n  \"description\": \"Ability to install, manage, and troubleshoot Python packages using pip, virtual environments, and requirements.txt\",  \n  \"tools\": [\"pip\", \"virtualenv\", \"sys.path\"],  \n  \"resources\": [\"Python Packaging User Guide\", \"pip documentation\"]  \n}  \n```  \n\nThis approach balances immediate resolution with long-term stability, ensuring minimal disruption to operations."
