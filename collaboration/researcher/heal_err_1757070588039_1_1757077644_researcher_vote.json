  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a ModuleNotFoundError for 'dexter_brain' when starting up the system. The error is a startup error, critical severity, and it's happened twice. The stack trace points to main.py trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nFirst, root cause. The most likely reason is that the 'dexter_brain' module isn't installed or not in the Python path. Maybe it's a missing dependency, or the environment isn't set up correctly. Since the error occurs during startup, it's probably a missing package or incorrect import path.\n\nImmediate action: The user needs to check if the module exists. They should verify if 'dexter_brain' is installed in the current Python environment. If not, install it. But how? Maybe it's a local package, so they might need to install it from a local directory or a specific repository. Alternatively, if the module is part of the project, maybe the Python path isn't set correctly, so adding the directory to PYTHONPATH could help.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure that the 'dexter_brain' module is properly installed and available in the environment. If it's a third-party package, add it to the requirements.txt. If it's a local module, make sure it's included in the project structure and the setup.py or pyproject.toml is configured correctly. Also, check the import statements to ensure they're correct.\n\nPrevention: Implement dependency checks during the build or startup process. Maybe add a script that verifies all required modules are present before starting the application. Also, using virtual environments and proper dependency management can prevent such issues. Monitoring for missing modules during deployment or updates could catch this earlier.\n\nRisk assessment: The immediate action of installing the module might have a low risk if it's a trusted package. However, if the module isn't available or has compatibility issues, that could cause more problems. The permanent fix of adjusting the project structure or dependencies might have medium risk if not tested properly. Prevention steps like dependency checks are low risk and beneficial.\n\nConfidence: High, because the error is straightforwardâ€”missing module. The solutions are standard practices for handling such issues.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because the Python interpreter cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. Missing installation of the module (not in the environment's Python packages)  \n2. Incorrect module naming or path in import statements  \n3. Environment misconfiguration (wrong Python path or virtual environment not activated)  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' exists in the environment:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip show dexter_brain || python -m pip show dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n2. If missing, install it (if available via PyPI):  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If it's a local/custom module:  \n   - Ensure the directory containing `dexter_brain/__init__.py` is in the project root or added to `PYTHONPATH`  \n   - Run:  \n     ```bash  \n     export PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/dexter_brain\"  \n     ```  \n3. Retry startup:  \n   ```bash  \n   python M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\main.py  \n   ```  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. If 'dexter_brain' is a third-party dependency:  \n   - Add to `requirements.txt`:  \n     ```  \n     dexter_brain==<version>  \n     ```  \n   - Ensure it's installed in the deployment environment  \n2. If it's a local module:  \n   - Structure project to include `dexter_brain` as a package in the root directory  \n   - Add to `setup.py` as an installable package or dependency  \n   - Use relative imports if appropriate  \n\nPrevention:  \n- Add pre-startup dependency checks to validate critical modules exist  \n- Use virtual environments with pinned dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt`)  \n- Implement CI/CD pipeline checks for import validity  \n- Monitor for `ModuleNotFoundError` in logs with alerts  \n\nRisk_Level: LOW  \nConfidence: HIGH  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
