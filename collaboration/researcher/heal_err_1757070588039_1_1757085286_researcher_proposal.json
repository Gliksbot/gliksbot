  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to parse through that first. The error is a STARTUP_ERROR with the message \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". The stack trace points to main.py trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nHmm, the root cause here is probably a missing module. The system can't find 'dexter_brain' when starting up. That could mean the module isn't installed, not in the right directory, or there's a path issue. Since it's a startup error, maybe the dependencies weren't properly set up in the environment.\n\nImmediate action should be to check if the module exists. The user might need to install it via pip if it's a third-party package. Alternatively, if it's a local module, the Python path might not include its location. So steps like checking the environment, installing the package, or adjusting sys.path could help.\n\nFor a permanent fix, ensuring that the module is included in the project's dependencies and that the environment is correctly configured. Maybe setting up a virtual environment with all required packages listed in requirements.txt. Also, checking the import statements to make sure they're correct.\n\nPrevention would involve adding checks during deployment to verify all dependencies are present. Maybe using tools like pip freeze to capture the environment, or CI/CD pipelines that test the setup. Monitoring for missing modules during startup could also help catch this earlier.\n\nRisk assessment: The immediate action of installing a package might have risks if it's not the correct version or if it introduces conflicts. Adjusting paths could affect other parts of the system. The permanent fix with virtual environments is lower risk but requires proper setup.\n\nI should structure the response with Analysis, Immediate Action, Permanent Fix, Prevention, and Risk. Also, check if any new skills are needed, but in this case, it's standard Python troubleshooting. So no new skill specs required. Just concrete steps.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in a directory included in the `PYTHONPATH` or project structure.  \n3. **Virtual Environment Issue**: The code is running outside the intended virtual environment where dependencies are installed.  \n\n**Context**:  \n- The error occurs during startup (`startup_event` in `main.py`), suggesting a dependency failure before the system fully initializes.  \n- No context is available, so assumptions about environment configuration are necessary.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Immediate Action**:  \n   - Verify the existence of `dexter_brain` in the environment.  \n   - Install the module if missing or add its path to `PYTHONPATH`.  \n2. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Ensure `dexter_brain` is included in the project’s dependency management (e.g., `requirements.txt`).  \n   - Configure the environment to consistently use the correct Python path.  \n3. **Prevention**:  \n   - Implement dependency checks during deployment.  \n   - Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### **Immediate_Action**  \n1. **Check Installed Packages**:  \n   Run `pip list | grep dexter_brain` (or `pip freeze`) to confirm if `dexter_brain` is installed.  \n2. **Install the Module (if missing)**:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If it’s a local/private module, navigate to its directory and install it:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n3. **Add Path (if module exists but is unrecognized)**:  \n   Temporarily add the module’s directory to `PYTHONPATH`:  \n   ```bash  \n   export PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/dexter_brain\"  \n   ```  \n   Or modify `main.py` to append the path programmatically:  \n   ```python  \n   import sys  \n   sys.path.append(\"/path/to/dexter_brain\")  \n   ```  \n\n#### **Permanent_Fix**  \n1. **Dependency Management**:  \n   - Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt`:  \n     ```  \n     dexter_brain==<version>  \n     ```  \n   - Use a virtual environment:  \n     ```bash  \n     python -m venv venv  \n     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate  \n     pip install -r requirements.txt  \n     ```  \n2. **Environment Configuration**:  \n   - Ensure the application runs with the correct environment activated.  \n   - For production, use a deployment tool (e.g., Docker) to containerize dependencies.  \n\n#### **Prevention**  \n1. **Automated Dependency Checks**:  \n   Add a pre-startup script to validate dependencies:  \n   ```bash  \n   # check_dependencies.sh  \n   python -c \"import dexter_brain\" || { echo \"Missing dexter_brain\"; exit 1; }  \n   ```  \n2. **Monitoring**:  \n   - Log missing module errors during startup.  \n   - Use tools like `Sentry` or `Prometheus` to alert on `ModuleNotFoundError`.  \n\n#### **Risk_Level**: **LOW**  \n- Installing a missing module or adjusting paths is low-risk if tested in a staging environment.  \n- Risks include version conflicts (mitigated by pinning versions in `requirements.txt`).  \n\n#### **Confidence**: **HIGH**  \n- The solution directly addresses the error’s root cause and aligns with standard Python dependency practices.  \n\n--- \n\n### SKILL_SPEC (Not Required)  \nThis task does not require new skills beyond standard Python troubleshooting. Existing knowledge of Python modules, virtual environments, and dependency management suffices.  \n\n--- \n\n**Vote**: This solution balances speed (immediate path fix) and robustness (permanent virtual environment setup) while minimizing disruption."
