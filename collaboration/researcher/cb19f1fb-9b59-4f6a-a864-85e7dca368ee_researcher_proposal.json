  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this user request. They want a script that counts words in a text file. Hmm, first, I need to understand exactly what they need. The user mentioned a script, so probably something they can run on their computer. They might be looking for a simple solution, maybe in a common language like Python, which is often used for such tasks.\n\nWait, the user is working with a team of LLMs, so maybe they need a structured approach. Let me break it down. The analysis part should outline the problem. They need to read a text file, process its contents, count each word, and output the counts. But what about edge cases? Like punctuation, case sensitivity, or different file encodings. The user might not have considered those, so the solution should handle them.\n\nFor the approach, the steps would be: read the file, clean the text (remove punctuation, lowercase), split into words, count using a dictionary or Counter, then output. The user might need the script to be efficient for large files, but maybe that's not a concern here. Let's assume a standard approach.\n\nImplementation: Python is a good choice. Use standard libraries like re for regex to clean the text, collections.Counter for counting. The script should take a filename as input, process it, and print the word counts. Also, handle exceptions like file not found. Oh, and the user might want the output sorted by frequency. Should I include that? The request just says count words, so maybe just a dictionary with counts. But showing the top N words could be helpful. Wait, the user didn't specify, so maybe stick to the basics.\n\nWait, the problem says \"counts words\", which could mean total word count or per-word frequency. The user probably wants the frequency of each word. So the script should output each word and how many times it appears. Also, need to decide on handling hyphenated words, apostrophes, etc. Using regex to replace non-alphanumeric characters except apostrophes might be better. Or split on whitespace and strip punctuation from each word.\n\nTesting the script with a sample file would be good, but the user might not need that in the code. Just the script. Also, the code should be cross-platform, so using Python's built-in functions is safe.\n\nSo putting it all together: the script reads the file, processes each line, cleans the words, counts them, and prints the results. The code should be concise but handle common edge cases. Also, include comments for clarity.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"if this requires a new skill, provide a SKILL_SPEC and code\". Since this is a straightforward task in Python, maybe no new skill is needed. But if the team isn't familiar with Python, perhaps a SKILL_SPEC for text processing in Python. But the user is asking for a script, so assuming they can run Python. So maybe no new skill required. But the initial proposal needs to check that.\n\nIn the analysis, I should note that the solution requires reading files, text processing, and counting. The approach uses standard libraries. The implementation is in Python. So the sections would be Analysis, Approach, Implementation with code.\n</think>\n\n**Analysis**  \nThe user requires a script to count words in a text file. Key considerations include:  \n- **Input**: A text file path provided by the user.  \n- **Processing**:  \n  - Handling punctuation (e.g., stripping commas, periods).  \n  - Case insensitivity (e.g., \"Hello\" and \"hello\" are the same word).  \n  - Splitting text into words (handling hyphens, apostrophes, etc.).  \n- **Output**: A dictionary or list of word-frequency pairs, optionally sorted.  \n- **Edge Cases**: Empty files, non-existent files, large files (memory efficiency).  \n\n**Approach**  \n1. **Read the File**: Use standard file I/O to read the text file.  \n2. **Text Cleaning**:  \n   - Convert text to lowercase.  \n   - Remove punctuation using regex (e.g., replace non-alphanumeric characters with spaces).  \n3. **Word Splitting**: Split the cleaned text into words using whitespace.  \n4. **Counting**: Use a dictionary or `collections.Counter` to tally word frequencies.  \n5. **Output**: Print or return the word counts (optionally sorted by frequency).  \n\n**Implementation**  \n```python\nimport re\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef count_words(file_path):\n    try:\n        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:\n            text = file.read().lower()\n            # Replace non-alphanumeric characters (except apostrophes) with spaces\n            cleaned_text = re.sub(r\"[^a-z0-9'\\s]\", ' ', text)\n            words = cleaned_text.split()\n            word_counts = Counter(words)\n            return word_counts\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"Error: File '{file_path}' not found.\")\n        return None\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    file_path = input(\"Enter the text file path: \")\n    counts = count_words(file_path)\n    if counts:\n        print(\"Word Counts:\")\n        for word, count in counts.most_common():\n            print(f\"{word}: {count}\")\n```\n\n**SKILL_SPEC (if required)**  \nIf the team lacks Python scripting expertise:  \n- **Skill**: Python text processing and file I/O.  \n- **Key Concepts**:  \n  - Reading files with `open()`.  \n  - Text normalization with `re.sub()` and `lower()`.  \n  - Efficient counting with `collections.Counter`.  \n- **Code**: Provided above.  \n\nThis solution balances simplicity and robustness, handling common edge cases while remaining easy to modify for specific needs (e.g., adjusting regex for custom punctuation rules)."
