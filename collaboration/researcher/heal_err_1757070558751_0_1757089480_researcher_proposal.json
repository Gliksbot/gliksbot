  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to parse through it step by step. The error is a STARTUP_ERROR with the message \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". The stack trace points to line 120 in main.py where it's trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nFirst, the root cause. The error is a ModuleNotFoundError, which typically means that the Python interpreter can't find the specified module. So, the 'dexter_brain' module isn't installed or isn't in the Python path. Since the error occurs during startup, it's likely that the module is missing from the environment where the application is running.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if the module is installed. If not, install it. But since the user might not have access to the environment, maybe they can check the requirements. Alternatively, if the module is part of the project, maybe it's not properly included in the deployment. So, checking the project structure and dependencies is key.\n\nFor a permanent fix, ensuring that all dependencies are correctly listed in requirements.txt or similar, and that the deployment process includes installing them. If 'dexter_brain' is a custom module, it should be part of the project's directory structure so that Python can find it. Maybe the module is in a different directory and the PYTHONPATH isn't set correctly.\n\nPrevention would involve adding checks during the build or deployment process to verify that all required modules are present. Also, using virtual environments to isolate dependencies and ensure consistency across environments. Monitoring for missing modules during startup could help catch such issues early.\n\nRisk assessment: Installing a missing module might introduce new dependencies or conflicts, but since the error is critical, the risk is justified. The confidence level here is high because the solution directly addresses the error message.\n\nNow, considering the system status with recent errors and critical errors, it's possible that other issues might be present, but focusing on this specific error first. The approach should be to first verify the presence of the module, then ensure it's correctly installed or included in the project.\n\nIf the module is a third-party package, installing it via pip would be the solution. If it's a local module, ensuring the directory structure is correct and that __init__.py files are present. Also, checking the import statements for any typos.\n\nIn the implementation steps, the user should check the requirements, install the missing module, verify the import path, and adjust the deployment process if necessary. For prevention, adding automated checks and environment validation before startup.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to:  \n1. **Missing Dependency**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., not in the project directory or a directory listed in `PYTHONPATH`).  \n3. **Deployment Issue**: The module was not included in the deployment package (e.g., missing from the repository or build artifacts).  \n\n**Context**:  \n- The error occurs during startup (`startup_event` in `main.py`), suggesting the module is critical for initialization.  \n- No context is available, so assumptions about the environment (e.g., local vs. production) must be cautious.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Immediate Action**:  \n   - Verify if `dexter_brain` is installed or present in the project.  \n   - If missing, install it or add it to the environment.  \n2. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Ensure `dexter_brain` is included in dependency management (e.g., `requirements.txt`).  \n   - Validate the module’s location and import path.  \n3. **Prevention**:  \n   - Add automated checks for required modules during deployment.  \n   - Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### **Immediate Action**  \n1. **Check Installation**:  \n   Run in the project’s environment:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip show dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If not found, proceed to install or locate the module.  \n\n2. **Install or Locate Module**:  \n   - If `dexter_brain` is a third-party package:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install dexter_brain  \n     ```  \n   - If it’s a local/custom module:  \n     - Ensure the module directory is in the project root or a path listed in `PYTHONPATH`.  \n     - Add `__init__.py` to the module directory (if missing).  \n\n3. **Test Import**:  \n   Run a Python shell in the project directory:  \n   ```python  \n   import dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If successful, restart the application.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Permanent Fix**  \n1. **Update Dependency Management**:  \n   - Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt`:  \n     ```txt  \n     dexter_brain==<version>  # Replace with actual version  \n     ```  \n   - If it’s a local module, ensure it’s included in the repository and deployed correctly.  \n\n2. **Validate Module Path**:  \n   - Confirm the module’s location matches the import statement. For example, if `dexter_brain` is in the project root, the import should work.  \n   - If the module is in a subdirectory, adjust the import (e.g., `from subdirectory import dexter_brain`).  \n\n3. **Deployment Script Adjustment**:  \n   - Ensure deployment scripts (e.g., CI/CD pipelines) install dependencies via `requirements.txt` and include all necessary modules.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Prevention**  \n1. **Automated Checks**:  \n   - Add a pre-startup script to validate required modules:  \n     ```bash  \n     # check_dependencies.sh  \n     python -c \"import dexter_brain\" || { echo \"Missing dexter_brain\"; exit 1; }  \n     ```  \n   - Integrate this script into the deployment process.  \n\n2. **Environment Isolation**:  \n   - Use virtual environments (e.g., `venv`) to ensure consistent dependencies:  \n     ```bash  \n     python -m venv venv  \n     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate  \n     pip install -r requirements.txt  \n     ```  \n\n3. **Monitoring**:  \n   - Implement logging for missing modules during startup.  \n   - Set up alerts for `ModuleNotFoundError` in monitoring tools (e.g., Sentry, Prometheus).  \n\n---\n\n### Risk Assessment  \n- **Risk Level**: **LOW**  \n  - Installing a missing module or adjusting paths is low-risk if tested in a staging environment first.  \n  - Dependency conflicts are possible but unlikely if `dexter_brain` is a standalone module.  \n- **Confidence**: **HIGH**  \n  - The solution directly addresses the error message and follows standard Python troubleshooting practices.  \n\n---\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (If Required)  \nIf the team lacks Python dependency management expertise, provide training on:  \n- Using `pip` and `requirements.txt`.  \n- Structuring Python projects with proper module paths.  \n- Virtual environment best practices.  \n\nExample code for dependency validation:  \n```python  \n# validate_dependencies.py  \ntry:  \n    import dexter_brain  \nexcept ImportError:  \n    raise RuntimeError(\"Critical dependency 'dexter_brain' is missing. Install it via 'pip install dexter_brain' or ensure it's in the project directory.\")  \n```  \n\nRun this script during deployment to catch errors early."
