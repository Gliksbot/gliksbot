  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a ModuleNotFoundError for 'dexter_brain' when starting up the system. The error is a STARTUP_ERROR with CRITICAL severity, so it's pretty serious. The stack trace shows that the main.py file is trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox, but that module doesn't exist.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out why 'dexter_brain' isn't found. Common reasons for this are missing installations, incorrect paths, or typos. Since the error is happening during startup, maybe the module isn't installed in the current environment. The user might have installed it in a different environment or not at all. Alternatively, the module could be part of a private package that's not properly linked.\n\nLooking at the context, there's no context available, so I can't see if there were recent changes. But the system status shows 7 recent errors and 2 critical ones, with 2 related startup errors. That suggests this might be a recurring issue, perhaps after some deployment or environment change.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if 'dexter_brain' is installed. If not, install it. But since it's a custom module, maybe it's part of the project structure. The user might need to ensure that the directory containing 'dexter_brain' is in the Python path. Alternatively, if it's a package that needs to be built, they might need to run a setup command.\n\nFor a permanent fix, the solution would involve making sure the module is properly installed or linked. If it's a local package, adding it to the PYTHONPATH or installing it in development mode could work. If it's a missing dependency, adding it to the requirements.txt or similar file would help. Also, checking the import statements for typos is essential.\n\nPrevention would involve setting up proper dependency management, ensuring that all required packages are listed and installed in the environment. Using virtual environments and continuous integration checks to verify that all imports work before deployment could prevent this in the future.\n\nRisk assessment: The immediate action of installing a missing package is low risk if it's a known dependency. However, if 'dexter_brain' is a custom module that's not properly versioned, there might be compatibility issues. The permanent fix of adjusting the environment or setup scripts is medium risk if not tested properly.\n\nConfidence in this solution is high because missing modules are a common issue and the steps are straightforward. But without more context, there's a slight chance that the problem is more complex, like a broken build process or incorrect directory structure.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the root cause is likely a missing or not properly installed 'dexter_brain' module. Immediate action is to install or link it. Permanent fix involves ensuring the module is part of the project's dependencies. Prevention through better dependency management and testing. Risks are low to medium depending on the exact cause.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because Python cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. Missing installation of the required package  \n2. Incorrect Python path configuration (module not in sys.path)  \n3. Broken or missing local package structure  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' is a local package: Check if the directory containing `dexter_brain/__init__.py` exists in the project root or Python path  \n2. If missing:  \n   - Restore from version control or package repository  \n   - OR Install required package via pip (if publicly available): `pip install dexter-brain`  \n3. If present but not recognized:  \n   - Add path to Python: `export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/gliksbot`  \n   - OR Run from project root directory to ensure relative paths resolve correctly  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. If local package:  \n   - Ensure `dexter_brain` directory is at the same level as `main.py`  \n   - Add explicit path injection in code:  \n     ```python\n     import sys\n     sys.path.insert(0, '/M/gliksbot/backend')\n     ```  \n2. If external package:  \n   - Add to requirements.txt: `dexter-brain==X.Y.Z`  \n   - Implement proper dependency management with virtual environments  \n3. Create setup.py for internal packages to enable proper installation:  \n   ```bash\n   python setup.py develop\n   ```  \n\nPrevention:  \n1. Implement dependency checks in CI/CD pipeline:  \n   ```bash\n   pip check && python -c \"import dexter_brain\"\n   ```  \n2. Add pre-startup validation script to verify critical imports  \n3. Use virtual environments with pinned dependencies  \n4. Monitor for ModuleNotFoundError patterns in logs  \n\nRisk_Level: LOW  \nConfidence: HIGH  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
