  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That's a Python error when a module isn't found. The stack trace points to line 120 in main.py trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox. So the immediate issue is that the 'dexter_brain' module isn't available in the Python environment where the code is running.\n\nLooking at the system status, there are 59 recent errors and 2 critical ones, including this one. The error type is STARTUP_ERROR, which means the system can't start up properly. The context isn't available, so maybe there's a lack of logging or the error occurs too early in the startup process.\n\nRoot cause analysis: The most likely causes are either the module isn't installed, the Python path isn't set correctly, or there's a typo in the import statement. Since the error is during startup, it's possible that the environment where the code is deployed doesn't have the 'dexter_brain' package installed. Alternatively, the package might be installed but not in the right directory, or the PYTHONPATH environment variable isn't configured to include the directory where 'dexter_brain' is located.\n\nImmediate actions would be to check if the module exists in the environment. The user could run a Python shell and try importing it. If it's not there, installing it via pip or another method would be necessary. But since the error is in the backend code, maybe the package is a local module that's part of the project but not properly included in the deployment.\n\nFor a permanent fix, ensuring that the 'dexter_brain' module is part of the project's dependencies. If it's a third-party package, adding it to requirements.txt. If it's a local module, making sure it's included in the source code repository and that the import paths are correct. Also, checking the directory structure to ensure that the module is in a location that Python can find.\n\nPrevention would involve setting up automated checks, like a CI/CD pipeline that verifies all dependencies are installed and imports work before deployment. Also, adding monitoring to track startup errors and missing modules. Maybe implementing a linter or static analysis tool to catch import errors early.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing module is low if it's a known dependency. However, if 'dexter_brain' is a custom module, there might be version compatibility issues. Also, changing the PYTHONPATH could have unintended consequences if not done carefully.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the solution should first check if the module is present, then install or include it as needed. The immediate action is to install the package or adjust the environment variables. The permanent fix would be to ensure the module is included in the deployment process. Prevention involves automated checks and monitoring.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in a directory included in the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.  \n3. **Deployment Issue**: The module is part of the project but was not included in the deployment package.  \n\n**Context**:  \n- The error occurs during startup (`startup_event` in `main.py`), preventing the system from initializing.  \n- No context is available, suggesting early-stage failure or incomplete logging.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Immediate Action**:  \n   - Verify if `dexter_brain` is installed or available in the project directory.  \n   - Temporarily adjust `PYTHONPATH` to include the module’s location.  \n   - Install the module if missing.  \n\n2. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Ensure `dexter_brain` is included in the project’s dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt`).  \n   - Validate the module’s directory structure and import paths.  \n   - Automate dependency checks in CI/CD pipelines.  \n\n3. **Prevention**:  \n   - Implement static code analysis to detect missing imports.  \n   - Add monitoring for startup failures and missing modules.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### **Immediate_Action**  \n1. **Check Module Availability**:  \n   ```bash  \n   # Navigate to the project directory  \n   cd M:\\gliksbot\\backend  \n\n   # Check if dexter_brain exists locally  \n   dir  \n\n   # Try importing in Python shell  \n   python -c \"import dexter_brain\"  \n   ```  \n\n2. **Install or Link the Module**:  \n   - If missing, install via pip (if it’s a third-party package):  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install dexter-brain  # Hypothetical package name  \n     ```  \n   - If it’s a local module, ensure it’s in the project directory and add its path:  \n     ```bash  \n     set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;M:\\gliksbot\\backend  \n     ```  \n\n3. **Restart the Service**:  \n   ```bash  \n   # Example for Windows service  \n   net stop gliksbot  \n   net start gliksbot  \n   ```  \n\n---\n\n#### **Permanent_Fix**  \n1. **Update Dependencies**:  \n   - Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt`:  \n     ```txt  \n     # requirements.txt  \n     dexter-brain==1.0.0  # Replace with actual version  \n     ```  \n   - If it’s a local module, ensure it’s included in the repository and referenced correctly in `__init__.py` files.  \n\n2. **Adjust Directory Structure**:  \n   - Ensure `dexter_brain` is at the same level as `main.py` or in a subdirectory included in `sys.path`.  \n\n3. **Automate Dependency Validation**:  \n   - Add a pre-startup script to verify dependencies:  \n     ```bash  \n     # validate_dependencies.sh  \n     python -c \"import dexter_brain\" || { echo \"Missing dexter_brain\"; exit 1; }  \n     ```  \n\n---\n\n#### **Prevention**  \n1. **Static Code Analysis**:  \n   - Use tools like `pylint` or `flake8` to flag missing imports during development.  \n\n2. **CI/CD Pipeline Checks**:  \n   - Add a step to validate all imports in the CI pipeline:  \n     ```yaml  \n     # .gitlab-ci.yml example  \n     test_imports:  \n       script:  \n         - python -c \"import dexter_brain\"  \n     ```  \n\n3. **Monitoring**:  \n   - Set up alerts for startup failures using tools like Prometheus or Sentry.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Risk Assessment**  \n- **Risk Level**: **LOW**  \n  - Installing a missing module or adjusting paths is low-risk if tested in a staging environment.  \n  - Changing `PYTHONPATH` could affect other services if not scoped properly.  \n\n- **Confidence**: **HIGH**  \n  - The solution directly addresses the root cause (missing module) and aligns with standard Python troubleshooting.  \n\n---\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (If Required)  \nIf the team lacks Python module management expertise, provide training on:  \n- Python package installation (`pip`, `venv`).  \n- Module import mechanics and `sys.path` configuration.  \n- CI/CD integration for dependency validation.  \n\n**Code Example for Path Adjustment**:  \n```python  \n# Add this to main.py before the import (temporary fix)  \nimport sys  \nsys.path.append(\"M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\backend\")  \n```  \n\nVote for this solution as it balances speed, safety, and long-term stability."
