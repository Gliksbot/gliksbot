  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The traceback points to line 120 in main.py where it's trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox. So the immediate issue is that the module isn't available in the environment where the code is running.\n\nLooking at the error type, it's a STARTUP_ERROR, which suggests that the system failed to initialize because this module is missing. The source is the system itself, so maybe the environment setup is incorrect. The context isn't available, but the system status shows recent and critical errors, so this might be part of a larger issue but the current problem is the missing module.\n\nRoot cause analysis: The most likely cause is that the 'dexter_brain' package isn't installed in the Python environment where the application is running. Alternatively, the package might be installed but not in the right location, or there's an issue with the Python path. Another possibility is that the package name is misspelled or the import statement is incorrect, but the error message says 'No module named', which usually points to the module not being found rather than a typo.\n\nImmediate action: The user needs to check if the package is installed. They can run 'pip show dexter_brain' or 'pip list' to see if it's present. If it's not installed, they should install it using 'pip install dexter_brain' or the appropriate method. If the package is a local module, they might need to ensure that the directory containing 'dexter_brain' is in the Python path. Alternatively, if it's a custom package, maybe it's not included in the current environment, like a virtualenv that's not activated.\n\nPermanent fix: The long-term solution would involve ensuring that all dependencies are properly listed in a requirements.txt file and that the environment is set up correctly. If 'dexter_brain' is a third-party package, adding it to the requirements and ensuring that the deployment process installs all dependencies. If it's an internal package, making sure it's included in the project's structure and that the installation process includes it, perhaps via a setup.py or by adding the path correctly.\n\nPrevention: Implementing dependency management practices, like using virtual environments, requirements files, and automated testing to catch missing dependencies before deployment. Also, monitoring for missing modules during startup could help detect such issues early.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing package is generally low if the package is trusted. However, if 'dexter_brain' is a third-party package, there could be security risks or compatibility issues. If it's a local module, the risk is lower. The confidence in this solution is high because the error is straightforward and the fix is common.\n\nWait, but what if the package name is incorrect? The error says 'dexter_brain' is missing. The user should verify the correct package name. Maybe it's supposed to be 'dexter_brain' but is actually named something else. Alternatively, if it's a local module, the directory structure might be wrong. For example, if the module is in a subdirectory, the import might need to be adjusted. But the error message suggests that the module isn't found at all, so the first step is to check installation.\n\nAnother angle: The system might be using a different Python environment than expected. For example, if the code is running in a virtual environment but the package is installed globally, or vice versa. Checking which Python interpreter is being used and ensuring that the packages are installed there.\n\nSo, putting it all together. The root cause is the missing module. Immediate action is to install it or adjust the path. Permanent fix is proper dependency management. Prevention through better practices. Risk is low to medium depending on the package source. Confidence high.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because the Python interpreter cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. The module is not installed in the current Python environment  \n2. The module is installed but not in the Python path  \n3. The module name is misspelled or structurally inaccessible  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify module installation: Run `pip show dexter_brain` in the environment where the application runs  \n2. If missing, install via: `pip install dexter_brain` (if public package) OR  \n   Install from local source: `pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain` (if internal package)  \n3. If installed but unrecognized, check Python path:  \n   - Add path programmatically: `import sys; sys.path.append('/path/to/dexter_brain')`  \n   - Or set PYTHONPATH environment variable before startup  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. Create/Update requirements.txt with:  \n   ```  \n   dexter_brain==<version>  # For public packages  \n   # OR for internal packages:  \n   -e /path/to/dexter_brain#egg=dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n2. Ensure deployment process includes:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install -r requirements.txt  \n   ```  \n3. If custom module, structure project as:  \n   ```  \n   project_root/  \n   ├── dexter_brain/  \n   │   └── __init__.py  \n   └── backend/  \n       └── main.py  \n   ```  \n   And install via:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install -e .  \n   ```  \n\nPrevention:  \n1. Implement dependency validation in CI/CD pipeline:  \n   ```bash  \n   # In CI config  \n   - pip check  # Verifies all dependencies are installed and compatible  \n   ```  \n2. Add pre-startup script to verify critical modules:  \n   ```python  \n   # precheck.py  \n   try:  \n       import dexter_brain  \n   except ImportError:  \n       raise RuntimeError(\"Critical module missing: dexter_brain\")  \n   ```  \n3. Monitor Python path integrity in production  \n\nRisk_Level: LOW  \nConfidence: HIGH  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
