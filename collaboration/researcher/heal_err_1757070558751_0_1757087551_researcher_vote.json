  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a ModuleNotFoundError for 'dexter_brain' when starting up their system. The error is a STARTUP_ERROR with CRITICAL severity, so it's pretty important to fix.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out why Python can't find the 'dexter_brain' module. Common reasons for this are missing installations, incorrect import paths, or issues with the Python environment.\n\nLooking at the stack trace, the error occurs in main.py line 120 when trying to import from 'dexter_brain.sandbox'. The system is trying to import a module that isn't present in the Python path. \n\nPossible root causes: \n1. The 'dexter_brain' package isn't installed in the current Python environment.\n2. The package is installed but not in the right directory, so Python can't find it.\n3. There's a typo in the module name, but the error message says 'No module named 'dexter_brain'', which suggests the name is correct as per the code.\n4. The Python path isn't set correctly, so it's not looking in the right place for modules.\n\nImmediate actions would involve checking if the package is installed. The user could run 'pip show dexter_brain' or 'pip list' to see if it's present. If not, installing it would be the next step. But if it's a custom module, maybe it's not in the right location. They should check the project structure to ensure that 'dexter_brain' is in a directory that's part of the Python path, like the project root or a subdirectory that's included.\n\nFor a permanent fix, if the module is missing, installing it via pip or adding it to the environment would work. If it's a local module, ensuring that the directory containing 'dexter_brain' is in the PYTHONPATH environment variable or adding it to sys.path in the code. Also, using virtual environments could help manage dependencies properly.\n\nPrevention would involve setting up proper dependency management, like a requirements.txt file that includes 'dexter_brain' so that it's installed consistently across environments. Also, using linters or tools like pyright to check for import errors before deployment. Monitoring for missing modules during startup could catch this earlier.\n\nRisks of the solution: If installing a package, there might be version conflicts. If modifying the Python path, it could introduce other issues if not done correctly. But the risk level here is probably medium since it's a straightforward fix once the cause is identified.\n\nConfidence in the solution would be high if the module is indeed missing and can be installed or added to the path. If there's more complexity, like a custom module not properly structured, confidence might be lower.\n\nSo putting it all together, the root cause is likely that the 'dexter_brain' module isn't installed or not in the Python path. Immediate action is to install the package or adjust the path. Permanent fix involves ensuring dependencies are managed and paths are correct. Prevention through dependency management and testing. Risk is medium, confidence high.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because the Python interpreter cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to either:  \n1. Missing installation of the required package  \n2. Incorrect Python path configuration  \n3. Module file location outside the project's root directory  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify module existence: Check if 'dexter_brain' exists in the project directory or as an installed package  \n2. Install missing package: Run `pip install dexter_brain` (if it's a public package)  \n3. Check Python path: Ensure the directory containing 'dexter_brain' is in PYTHONPATH  \n4. Test import: Run `python -c \"import dexter_brain\"` to validate module availability  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. Create virtual environment: Use `python -m venv venv` and activate it  \n2. Install dependencies: Add `dexter_brain` to requirements.txt and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`  \n3. Adjust module structure: If local module, ensure it's in the root directory or add its path to sys.path in main.py:  \n```python\nimport sys\nsys.path.append(\"path/to/dexter_brain\")\n```  \n4. Use proper import syntax: Confirm import statement matches module structure  \n\nPrevention:  \n1. Implement dependency tracking: Maintain requirements.txt with all dependencies  \n2. Add pre-startup check: Create a script to validate all required modules before boot  \n3. Use linter: Configure pyright/pylint to check imports during development  \n4. Monitor startup logs: Set up alerts for ModuleNotFoundError in production  \n\nRisk_Level: MEDIUM (Potential for version conflicts when installing packages)  \nConfidence: HIGH (Standard Python module resolution issue with clear solutions)  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
