  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The traceback shows it's happening in main.py line 120 during the startup event. The system is trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox, but the module isn't present.\n\nLooking at the error type, it's a STARTUP_ERROR with CRITICAL severity. The system has tried once, and there are 2 related startup errors. The context isn't available, which might make it a bit harder, but the stack trace gives enough info.\n\nRoot cause analysis: The most likely reason is that the 'dexter_brain' module isn't installed in the Python environment where the application is running. Alternatively, it could be installed in a different environment, or the module's directory isn't in the Python path. Another possibility is a typo in the module name, but the error message seems consistent, so maybe not. Since the error occurs during startup, it's probably a missing dependency.\n\nImmediate action: The user needs to check if the module exists. They can try installing it via pip, but if it's a custom module, it might need to be added to the project structure. They should verify the Python path and environment. Maybe the virtual environment isn't activated, or the module is in a different location.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure that the 'dexter_brain' module is properly installed and accessible in the environment. If it's a third-party package, install it. If it's a local module, make sure it's included in the project and the path is set correctly. Also, check the project's requirements.txt to include it for future deployments.\n\nPrevention: Implement dependency checks during deployment, use virtual environments with pinned versions, and have monitoring to alert when modules are missing. Also, include the module in version control if it's custom, and ensure that the build process installs all necessary dependencies.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a new module could be medium if it's a third-party package with potential conflicts. If it's a local module, the risk is lower. The confidence in the solution depends on whether the module exists and can be installed properly.\n\nNow, structuring the response according to the required format. Need to make sure each section is addressed clearly. Also, check if any new skills are needed. Since this is a standard Python module issue, probably no new skills required. But if the module is custom, maybe the user needs to create it, but the error suggests it's missing, not that it's broken.\n\nWait, the error is during startup, so the system can't start without it. Immediate action should be steps to install or locate the module. Permanent fix would be ensuring it's part of the deployment process. Prevention could involve checking dependencies before startup.\n\nI think that's the plan. Now, format the answer as per the user's instructions.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., installed in a different environment or directory).  \n3. **Custom Module Missing**: If `dexter_brain` is a local/custom module, it may not be included in the project structure or repository.  \n\n**Immediate Action**:  \n1. Verify if `dexter_brain` is a third-party or custom module.  \n2. Check the Python environment (e.g., virtual environment activation, `sys.path` configuration).  \n3. Attempt to install the module (if third-party) or ensure it is in the correct directory (if custom).  \n\n**Permanent Fix**:  \n1. **Third-Party Module**: Install the module using `pip install dexter_brain` (if available on PyPI).  \n2. **Custom Module**: Ensure the module is included in the project directory and added to version control. Update `sys.path` in `main.py` to include the moduleâ€™s path if necessary.  \n3. Update `requirements.txt` to include the module for future deployments.  \n\n**Prevention**:  \n1. **Dependency Management**: Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to track dependencies.  \n2. **Environment Isolation**: Enforce the use of virtual environments (e.g., `venv`) to avoid path conflicts.  \n3. **Pre-Startup Checks**: Add a script to validate required modules before starting the application.  \n4. **Monitoring**: Implement logging/alerting for missing modules during deployment or startup.  \n\n**Risk Assessment**:  \n- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM (Installing third-party modules may introduce conflicts; custom module fixes depend on code availability).  \n- **Confidence**: HIGH (The error is straightforward, but resolution depends on module origin).  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Diagnose Module Origin**: Determine if `dexter_brain` is third-party or custom.  \n2. **Resolve Path/Installation**: Install or re-link the module.  \n3. **Automate Dependency Checks**: Integrate checks into CI/CD pipelines.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### 1. **Immediate Action**  \n```bash  \n# Check Python environment  \nwhich python  \npip show dexter_brain  # Check if installed  \n\n# If third-party module:  \npip install dexter_brain  \n\n# If custom module:  \n# Ensure the module directory is in the project root or add its path:  \nexport PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/dexter_brain\"  \n```  \n\n#### 2. **Permanent Fix**  \n**For Custom Modules**:  \n```python  \n# In main.py, add path if needed (temporary fix):  \nimport sys  \nsys.path.append(\"/path/to/dexter_brain\")  \n```  \n\n**Update Requirements**:  \n```bash  \n# Generate requirements.txt  \npip freeze > requirements.txt  \n```  \n\n#### 3. **Prevention Script**  \nCreate a `prestart_check.py` script:  \n```python  \nimport importlib.util  \nrequired_modules = [\"dexter_brain\"]  \n\nfor module in required_modules:  \n    if not importlib.util.find_spec(module):  \n        raise ImportError(f\"Missing required module: {module}\")  \n```  \nRun this before starting the application:  \n```bash  \npython prestart_check.py && python main.py  \n```  \n\n#### 4. **Monitoring**  \nAdd logging to `main.py`:  \n```python  \nimport logging  \ntry:  \n    import dexter_brain  \nexcept ImportError as e:  \n    logging.critical(\"Startup failed: %s\", e)  \n    raise  \n```  \n\n---\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (If Needed)  \n**Skill**: Python Module Path Management  \n**Code**:  \n```python  \n# Function to dynamically add paths  \ndef add_to_pythonpath(path):  \n    import sys  \n    if path not in sys.path:  \n        sys.path.append(path)  \n\n# Usage:  \nadd_to_pythonpath(\"/custom/module/path\")  \n```  \n\n**Note**: Use this only if the module location is dynamic or non-standard.  \n\n--- \n\n**Vote**: This solution balances immediate resolution with long-term stability, assuming `dexter_brain` is a valid module. If the module is missing entirely, further investigation into its origin is required."
