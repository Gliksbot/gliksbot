  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The stack trace shows the error occurs in main.py line 120 when importing from dexter_brain.sandbox. So the immediate issue is a missing module.\n\nLooking at the system status, there are 23 recent errors and 2 critical ones, with 2 related startup errors. That suggests this might be a recurring issue. The context isn't available, so I have to rely on the given info.\n\nRoot cause: The module 'dexter_brain' isn't installed or not in the Python path. Maybe it's a missing dependency, or the environment isn't set up correctly. Could be a virtual environment issue where the module isn't installed there, or the project structure changed so the module isn't in the right location.\n\nImmediate action: Check if the module exists in the environment. If it's a package, install it using pip. If it's a local module, ensure it's in the correct directory and the Python path includes it. Restart the service after installing.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure the module is included in the project's dependencies. If it's a third-party package, add it to requirements.txt. If it's a local module, make sure the project structure is correct and the module is properly imported. Maybe set up a virtual environment and install all dependencies there.\n\nPrevention: Implement dependency management, use virtual environments, and have CI/CD checks to ensure all required modules are present. Monitor for missing modules during deployment. Maybe add a check in the startup script to verify all required modules are installed before proceeding.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing module is low if it's a known dependency. However, if the module isn't supposed to be there, it might indicate a larger issue. The confidence here is high because this is a common issue with straightforward solutions.\n\nWait, but the error is during startup, so the system can't even start. So immediate action would be to install the module. But how? The user might not have access to the environment. The solution should guide them to check the environment, install the module, and ensure it's in the right place.\n\nAlso, considering the system source is 'system', maybe the environment variables are not set correctly. Or the code was deployed without including the necessary modules.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the 'dexter_brain' module is part of the project but not properly included in the deployment package. So checking the file structure and ensuring that the module is present in the correct location relative to main.py.\n\nSo steps for immediate action: Check if dexter_brain exists in the project directory. If not, install it via pip or add it to the project. If it's a local module, adjust the import or the sys.path to include its location.\n\nPermanent fix would involve ensuring that all dependencies are properly declared and installed in the environment, and that the project structure is correct.\n\nPrevention could include adding a setup.py or requirements.txt that includes all necessary packages, and using a virtual environment to isolate dependencies. Also, during deployment, verify that all modules are present.\n\nRisk level for the solution is low because installing a missing module is a standard procedure. Confidence is high because this is a common issue with known fixes.\n\nI think that's a solid analysis. Now, structuring the answer according to the required format.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to one of the following root causes:  \n1. **Missing Dependency**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in a directory included in the `PYTHONPATH` or project structure.  \n3. **Environment Misconfiguration**: A virtual environment is not activated, or dependencies are installed in a different environment.  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. **Verify Module Installation**: Run `pip show dexter_brain` to check if the module is installed. If not, install it using `pip install dexter_brain` (if it’s a third-party package) or ensure it’s included in the project’s dependencies.  \n2. **Check Project Structure**: Confirm that `dexter_brain` is a local module and exists in the correct directory relative to `main.py`. If missing, restore the module files or adjust the import path.  \n3. **Activate Correct Environment**: If using a virtual environment, activate it and reinstall dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  \n4. **Restart Service**: After fixes, restart the service to apply changes.  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. **Dependency Management**: Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` (if third-party) or ensure it’s included in the project repository.  \n2. **Environment Standardization**: Use a `Pipfile`, `poetry`, or Docker to enforce consistent environments across development and production.  \n3. **Code Adjustments**: If `dexter_brain` is a local module, ensure it’s in a directory listed in `sys.path` (e.g., same directory as `main.py` or a subdirectory added via `sys.path.append`).  \n\nPrevention:  \n1. **Automated Checks**: Integrate a pre-startup script to verify critical modules are installed and importable.  \n2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Add a build step to validate dependencies and project structure before deployment.  \n3. **Monitoring**: Implement logging to track missing modules during startup and trigger alerts for quick resolution.  \n\nRisk_Level: **LOW** (Installing missing modules is a standard, low-risk operation. Risks arise only if the module is not intended to be present, but the error context confirms it’s required.)  \nConfidence: **HIGH** (This is a common Python error with well-documented solutions.)  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
