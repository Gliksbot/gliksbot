  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user provided a system error with a stack trace showing a recursion depth exceeded in the error_healer module. The error message is \"Healing session failed: maximum recursion depth exceeded\". From the stack trace, it looks like there's a recursive loop between log_error and _detect_patterns methods in the error_tracker.py file.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out why this recursion is happening. The log_error method calls _detect_patterns, which in turn calls log_error again. This creates an infinite loop if there's no base case to stop it. The original error might be triggering a pattern that causes the error tracker to keep logging the same error, leading to the recursion.\n\nLooking at the context, the original error ID is err_1757087886622_179, and the healing session is trying to handle it. But the healing process itself is causing a recursion. Maybe the error_healer is trying to log an error during the healing process, which then triggers another error, and so on.\n\nFor the immediate action, I should suggest stopping the current healing process to prevent further recursion. Then, maybe increase the recursion limit temporarily, but that's a band-aid. The real fix would be to modify the code to avoid the recursive calls. Perhaps adding a check to prevent re-logging the same error in a loop.\n\nThe permanent fix would involve refactoring the error_tracker to avoid recursion. Maybe using a loop instead of recursion, or adding a flag to indicate that an error is already being processed. Also, ensuring that the _detect_patterns method doesn't call log_error in a way that creates a loop.\n\nPrevention could involve adding monitoring for recursion depth, setting limits on how many times an error can be logged, or implementing a circuit breaker pattern to halt the error handling if it detects a loop.\n\nRisk assessment: Changing the recursion limit might have side effects on other parts of the system. Refactoring the code could introduce new bugs if not done carefully. Need to test thoroughly.\n\nSo, the analysis would point to the recursive method calls without a proper exit condition. Immediate action is to stop the current process and adjust recursion limit. Permanent fix is code changes to eliminate recursion. Prevention through monitoring and code reviews. Risk level medium because of potential side effects from code changes.\n</think>\n\n# SYSTEM ERROR ANALYSIS & SOLUTION PROPOSAL  \n**Collaboration Session ID:** heal_err_1757088096781_672_1757088368  \n\n---\n\n## **Analysis**  \n**Root Cause:**  \nThe error `maximum recursion depth exceeded` stems from an infinite recursive loop between `log_error()` and `_detect_patterns()` in `error_tracker.py`. The stack trace shows 50+ recursive calls, indicating:  \n1. A missing base case in the recursion logic  \n2. A self-referential error pattern where detecting an error triggers another error detection attempt  \n3. Likely caused by the `error_healer` attempting to log an error during its own healing process  \n\n**Key Observations:**  \n- The recursion originates in `error_healer._initiate_healing_session` → `error_tracker.log_error()` → `error_tracker._detect_patterns()` → `error_tracker.log_error()` (recursion)  \n- The original error (`err_1757087886622_179`) may be a \"poison pill\" error that triggers this loop when processed  \n- System has 21 prior `HEALING_FAILED` errors, suggesting a systemic issue  \n\n---\n\n## **Approach**  \n**Immediate Action:**  \n1. **Halt Active Healing Session**  \n   - Terminate the current healing process for session `heal_err_1757087886622_179` to stop recursion  \n   - Command: `system.healing.abort(session_id=\"heal_err_1757087886622_179\")`  \n\n2. **Increase Recursion Limit Temporarily**  \n   - Mitigate immediate crash risk by raising Python's recursion limit:  \n     ```python\n     import sys\n     sys.setrecursionlimit(sys.getrecursionlimit() + 1000)\n     ```  \n   - *Note:* This is a temporary workaround, not a fix  \n\n**Permanent Fix:**  \n1. **Break Recursion Cycle**  \n   - Modify `error_tracker.py` to:  \n     - Add a `processing` flag to prevent reentrant calls  \n     - Replace recursion with iterative pattern detection  \n   - Example code changes:  \n     ```python\n     class ErrorTracker:\n         def __init__(self):\n             self._processing = False  # New flag\n\n         def log_error(self, error):\n             if self._processing:\n                 return  # Prevent recursion\n             self._processing = True\n             try:\n                 self._detect_patterns(error)\n             finally:\n                 self._processing = False\n\n         def _detect_patterns(self, error):\n             # Rewrite recursion as iterative loop\n             patterns = [error]\n             while patterns:\n                 current = patterns.pop()\n                 # Process current error, add new errors to patterns if needed\n                 if self._should_log(current):\n                     patterns.append(self._generate_new_error(current))\n             self.log_error(current)  # Remove this line if not needed\n     ```  \n\n2. **Error Isolation**  \n   - Implement circuit breaker pattern:  \n     - If >5 healing attempts fail for an error, quarantine it for manual review  \n\n**Prevention:**  \n1. **Monitoring**  \n   - Add metrics for:  \n     - Recursion depth in error handling  \n     - Healing attempt counts per error  \n   - Alert on recursion depth > 100  \n\n2. **Code Changes**  \n   - Static analysis rule to flag recursive calls between `log_error` and `_detect_patterns`  \n   - Unit tests simulating recursive error scenarios  \n\n---\n\n## **Implementation**  \n\n### **SKILL_SPEC: ErrorTracker Recursion Fix**  \n```python\n# error_tracker.py\n\nclass ErrorTracker:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._processing = False\n        self._max_attempts = 5\n\n    def log_error(self, error):\n        \"\"\"Thread-safe error logging with recursion prevention\"\"\"\n        if self._processing:\n            return\n        self._processing = True\n        try:\n            attempt = 0\n            while attempt < self._max_attempts:\n                attempt += 1\n                self._detect_patterns(error)\n                # Break condition: error resolved or no new patterns found\n                if not self._should_continue(error):\n                    break\n            else:\n                self._quarantine_error(error)\n        finally:\n            self._processing = False\n\n    def _detect_patterns(self, error):\n        \"\"\"Iterative pattern detection\"\"\"\n        # Implementation details here\n        pass\n\n    def _should_continue(self, error):\n        \"\"\"Determine if recursion should continue\"\"\"\n        # Criteria: new errors generated, thresholds not exceeded\n        return False\n\n    def _quarantine_error(self, error):\n        \"\"\"Move error to manual review queue\"\"\"\n        pass\n```\n\n### **Rollout Plan**  \n1. **Phase 1 (0-24h):**  \n   - Deploy to staging environment  \n   - Test with simulated recursive errors  \n\n2. **Phase 2 (24-48h):**  \n   - Deploy to 5% of production instances  \n   - Monitor metrics and alerts  \n\n3. **Phase 3 (48h+):**  \n   - Full rollout after validation  \n\n---\n\n## **Risk Assessment**  \n**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  \n- **Potential Issues:**  \n  - Increased memory usage from iterative approach  \n  - Edge cases in pattern detection logic  \n- **Mitigations:**  \n  - Gradual rollout with canary deployments  \n  - Comprehensive test suite  \n\n**Confidence Level:** HIGH  \n- The solution directly addresses the recursion root cause  \n- Circuit breaker pattern proven in similar systems  \n\n--- \n\n**Recommendation:** Approve and implement the proposed changes starting with Phase 1."
