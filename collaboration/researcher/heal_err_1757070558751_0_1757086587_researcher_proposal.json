  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully. The error is a STARTUP_ERROR with the message \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". The stack trace points to line 120 in main.py trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nFirst, the root cause. The error is a ModuleNotFoundError, which usually means the module isn't installed or not in the Python path. Since it's a startup error, maybe the module isn't installed in the environment where the code is running. Alternatively, the module might be present but not properly linked or there's a typo in the import statement.\n\nLooking at the context, there's no context available, so I can't see if there were recent changes. But the system status shows recent errors and critical ones. The related startup errors are 2, so maybe this has happened before. The source is 'system', which might indicate it's a core module.\n\nImmediate action: The user needs to check if the dexter_brain module is installed. If not, install it. But how? If it's a third-party package, pip install. If it's a local module, ensure it's in the right directory and the Python path includes it. Alternatively, check for typos in the import statement. Maybe the module name is different, like 'dexter_brain' vs 'dexterbrain' or something.\n\nPermanent fix: If the module is missing, install it. If it's a local module, ensure the project structure is correct and the module is included in the source control. Also, check the Python environment—maybe the virtual environment isn't activated, or the code is running in a different environment where the module isn't installed.\n\nPrevention: Implement checks during deployment to ensure all dependencies are installed. Use requirements.txt or Pipfile to manage dependencies. Set up monitoring to check for missing modules during startup. Also, code reviews to catch incorrect import statements.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing module is low if it's a known dependency. However, if the module isn't supposed to be there, it might indicate a larger issue. But given the error, it's likely a missing dependency. Confidence is high because this is a common issue with a straightforward solution.\n\nWait, but what if 'dexter_brain' is a custom module that's part of the project? Then the issue might be that the module isn't in the right location. The code is in M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\main.py, so maybe the dexter_brain directory should be in the same parent directory or in a location added to sys.path.\n\nSo, possible steps: Check if dexter_brain exists in the project structure. If not, install it. If it's a local module, ensure the import is correct and the directory is in the Python path. Maybe the code is trying to import from a package that's not properly installed.\n\nAnother angle: The error occurs during startup, so the system can't initialize. Immediate action would be to install the missing module. If the module is part of the project, maybe the developer forgot to include it in the repository or the build process.\n\nFor the implementation, the user might need to run pip install dexter_brain if it's a package. If it's a local module, they should check the directory structure and add it to the path. Alternatively, create a symlink or adjust the sys.path in the code.\n\nPrevention could involve adding a check in the startup script to verify that all required modules are present. Also, using virtual environments to ensure dependencies are isolated and properly managed.\n\nRisk level: Low, because installing a missing module is a standard procedure. Confidence is high because this is a common error with a clear solution.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**: The error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This typically occurs due to:  \n1. Missing installation of the module (if it’s a third-party package).  \n2. Incorrect project structure (if `dexter_brain` is a local module not in the Python path).  \n3. Environment misconfiguration (e.g., wrong virtual environment or `PYTHONPATH` not set).  \n\n**Context**: The error occurs in `main.py` during the `startup_event`, suggesting the module is critical for initialization. The absence of context implies no recent code changes are logged, but the error’s recurrence (2 related startup errors) hints at a systemic issue.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Immediate Action**:  \n   - Verify if `dexter_brain` is a local module or third-party package.  \n   - Check the project directory structure to ensure `dexter_brain` exists and is accessible.  \n   - If missing, install the module or restore it from version control.  \n\n2. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Ensure dependencies are explicitly declared (e.g., `requirements.txt`).  \n   - Validate the Python environment and path configuration.  \n\n3. **Prevention**:  \n   - Implement dependency checks during deployment.  \n   - Use automated testing to validate module availability pre-startup.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### 1. **Immediate Action**  \n**Steps**:  \n```bash\n# Navigate to the project root (adjust path as needed)\ncd M:\\gliksbot\n\n# Check if dexter_brain exists locally\ndir backend/dexter_brain  # If local module expected here\n\n# If missing, install as a package (if applicable)\npip install dexter_brain  # Only if it's a published package\n\n# If local module is missing, restore from version control\ngit restore backend/dexter_brain  # Or re-add via git\n\n# Verify Python path includes the project root\necho $PYTHONPATH  # Ensure M:\\gliksbot is included\n# If not, add it temporarily:\nset PYTHONPATH=M:\\gliksbot;%PYTHONPATH%  # Windows\n# or\nexport PYTHONPATH=/path/to/gliksbot:$PYTHONPATH  # Linux/macOS\n\n# Retry startup\npython backend/main.py\n```\n\n#### 2. **Permanent Fix**  \n**Code/Environment Adjustments**:  \n- **For Local Modules**:  \n  Ensure `dexter_brain` is in the correct directory and included in the project’s source control.  \n- **For Third-Party Packages**:  \n  Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt`:  \n  ```txt\n  dexter_brain==<version>\n  ```  \n  Then run:  \n  ```bash\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  ```  \n- **Environment Configuration**:  \n  Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:  \n  ```bash\n  python -m venv venv\n  source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS\n  venv\\Scripts\\activate  # Windows\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  ```  \n\n#### 3. **Prevention**  \n- **Dependency Validation Script**:  \n  Add a pre-startup check to verify critical modules:  \n  ```python\n  # validate_modules.py\n  try:\n      import dexter_brain\n  except ImportError:\n      raise RuntimeError(\"Critical module 'dexter_brain' is missing. Install dependencies first.\")\n  ```  \n  Run this script before starting the application.  \n\n- **CI/CD Integration**:  \n  Add a pipeline step to validate dependencies during deployment.  \n\n#### 4. **Risk Assessment**  \n- **Risk Level**: **LOW**  \n  Installing missing modules or adjusting paths is a low-risk operation.  \n- **Confidence**: **HIGH**  \n  This solution addresses the most common causes of `ModuleNotFoundError`.  \n\n---\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (If Required)  \nIf `dexter_brain` is a custom module not in version control:  \n```python\n# Create a minimal dexter_brain module as a placeholder\n# File: backend/dexter_brain/__init__.py\nprint(\"dexter_brain module initialized\")\n```  \nThis allows the system to start while the actual module is developed or restored.  \n\n--- \n\n**Collaboration Note**: Confirm with the team whether `dexter_brain` is a third-party package or local module to refine the solution."
