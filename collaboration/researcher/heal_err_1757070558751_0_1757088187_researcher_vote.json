  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a ModuleNotFoundError for 'dexter_brain' when starting up their system. The error is a startup error, critical severity, and it's happening during the import in main.py.\n\nFirst, root cause. The error message says the module isn't found. That usually means the package isn't installed in the Python environment where the script is running. Alternatively, maybe it's installed but in a different environment, or the name is misspelled. But the traceback shows the import is from 'dexter_brain.sandbox', so the module name is correct in the code. So the most likely cause is that the package isn't installed in the current environment.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if the package is installed. If not, install it. But how? The user might need to run pip install dexter_brain. But wait, is that a third-party package or a local one? If it's a local package, maybe it's not in the right directory, or the Python path isn't set correctly. Alternatively, maybe the environment is a virtualenv that doesn't have the package installed.\n\nLooking at the system status, there are recent errors and critical errors. But the context isn't available, so maybe the user hasn't provided more info. The error is happening on startup, so the system can't initialize without this module.\n\nFor a permanent fix, ensuring that the package is installed in the correct environment. If it's a dependency, adding it to the requirements.txt or pyproject.toml so that it's installed automatically when setting up the environment. If it's a local package, making sure it's in the right place and that the environment is set up to include it in the Python path.\n\nPrevention could involve checking dependencies during deployment, using virtual environments with pinned versions, and having tests that verify all imports work. Also, monitoring for missing modules in the logs.\n\nRisks of the solution: If installing the package introduces conflicts with other dependencies, that could cause more issues. But since the error is critical and the system can't start, the immediate action is necessary. The risk level here is medium because installing a missing package is generally safe but could have unforeseen consequences if there are version mismatches.\n\nConfidence in the solution: High, because the error is straightforward. If the package is installed, the error should go away. But if the package isn't available or there's a typo, that's a different issue. But given the info, this is the best approach.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRoot Cause: The 'dexter_brain' module is not installed in the Python environment where the application is running.\n\nImmediate Action: Install the missing package using pip install dexter_brain. If it's a local package, ensure it's in the correct directory and the environment is set up to include it.\n\nPermanent Fix: Add 'dexter_brain' to the project's dependency list (e.g., requirements.txt) to ensure it's installed during environment setup. If it's a local module, ensure the project structure and PYTHONPATH are correctly configured.\n\nPrevention: Implement dependency checks during deployment, use virtual environments with pinned dependencies, and include import tests in the test suite.\n\nRisk Level: Medium, as installing a new package could introduce conflicts, but necessary for system startup.\n\nConfidence: High, since the error is a clear missing module issue.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because the Python interpreter cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This typically happens when the package is either not installed, installed in a different environment, or not properly linked in the project structure.  \nImmediate_Action: 1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' is installed: Run `pip show dexter_brain` in the active Python environment.  \n2. If missing, install it: `pip install dexter_brain` (or `pip3` depending on setup).  \n3. If it's a local/custom module, ensure the directory containing 'dexter_brain' is in the Python path (e.g., via `PYTHONPATH` or `sys.path.append`).  \nPermanent_Fix: 1. Add 'dexter_brain' to the project's `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` to ensure consistent installation across environments.  \n2. If local, structure the project to include 'dexter_brain' as a package (e.g., with `__init__.py`) and ensure proper relative imports or path configuration.  \nPrevention: 1. Use virtual environments with pinned dependencies.  \n2. Implement CI/CD checks to validate all imports during testing.  \n3. Monitor logs for `ModuleNotFoundError` and alert on missing dependencies.  \nRisk_Level: MEDIUM (Installing new packages can introduce conflicts, but this is necessary for core functionality).  \nConfidence: HIGH (The solution directly addresses the missing module issue).  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
