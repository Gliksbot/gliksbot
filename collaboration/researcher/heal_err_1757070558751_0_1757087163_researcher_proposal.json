  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That's a Python error, right? When Python can't find a module, it usually means the module isn't installed or isn't in the right directory. The traceback shows it's happening in main.py when trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox. So the system is trying to start up but can't find this module.\n\nLooking at the error details: it's a STARTUP_ERROR of CRITICAL severity. The source is 'system', which probably means it's a core component. The timestamp is recent, and there have been 77 recent errors, with 2 critical ones. The related startup errors are 2, so this might be a recurring issue.\n\nThe mission is to diagnose and provide healing solutions. The analysis required has five parts: root cause, immediate action, permanent fix, prevention, and risk assessment.\n\nFor root cause: The most likely reason is that the 'dexter_brain' module isn't installed in the Python environment where the backend is running. Alternatively, the Python path might not include the directory where dexter_brain is located. Another possibility is that the module was installed but got corrupted or removed accidentally.\n\nImmediate action: The user needs to check if the module is installed. They can run 'pip show dexter_brain' or 'pip list' to see if it's present. If not, install it. If it's a local module, maybe the path is wrong. They might need to add the directory to PYTHONPATH or check the import statement. Alternatively, if the module is part of a package, maybe the package isn't properly installed.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure that the module is properly installed and available in the environment. If it's a third-party package, add it to the requirements.txt. If it's a local module, make sure it's in the correct location and the project structure is set up correctly. Maybe the project uses a virtual environment, and the module isn't installed there.\n\nPrevention: Implement dependency management, like using a requirements.txt file and ensuring that the environment is set up correctly on startup. Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies. Add checks during deployment to verify all required modules are present. Monitor for missing modules and set up alerts.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing module could be low if it's a known package. However, if the module has dependencies that conflict with existing ones, there might be issues. Also, if the module isn't supposed to be there, installing it might introduce security risks. But given the error, it's necessary.\n\nNow, considering the system context: the backend is in M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\main.py. So the project is on a Windows machine. The dexter_brain module might be part of the project or a separate package. If it's part of the project, maybe the structure is wrong. For example, if dexter_brain is a subdirectory with an __init__.py file, but the import is incorrect.\n\nWait, the import is 'from dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox'. So dexter_brain should be a package (a directory with __init__.py) that has a sandbox module. If the project structure is such that dexter_brain isn't in the Python path, that's the issue.\n\nPossible scenarios: The dexter_brain package is not installed in the environment. Or the project's root directory isn't added to the Python path, so when main.py runs, it can't find the package. Or maybe the package is installed but in a different environment.\n\nImmediate steps: Check if dexter_brain is installed. If not, install it. If it's a local package, check the directory structure. Maybe the user needs to install the package in development mode, like using 'pip install -e .' from the project root.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure that the package is properly installed. If it's a third-party package, add it to requirements.txt. If it's part of the project, structure the project so that the package is in the right place and the setup.py or pyproject.toml includes it.\n\nPrevention: Use a virtual environment, pin dependencies, use CI/CD checks to ensure all dependencies are installed, and monitor for missing modules.\n\nRisk level: Installing a missing module is generally low risk if it's a known package. But if the package has issues, that could be a problem. However, since the system is failing without it, the risk is justified.\n\nConfidence: High, because the error is straightforward. The main issue is determining whether it's an installation issue or a path issue. But the solution would involve installing the package or adjusting the path.\n\nSo putting it all together in the required format.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The `dexter_brain` module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in a directory included in the `PYTHONPATH` or Python's module search path.  \n3. **Project Structure Issue**: If `dexter_brain` is a local package, the project directory structure may be misconfigured (e.g., missing `__init__.py` files or incorrect imports).  \n\n**Immediate Action**:  \n1. Verify if `dexter_brain` is installed:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip show dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n2. If missing, install it (if it’s a third-party package):  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n3. If it’s a local package:  \n   - Ensure the directory containing `dexter_brain` is in the project root or added to `PYTHONPATH`.  \n   - Run the application from the project root directory.  \n\n**Permanent Fix**:  \n1. **For Third-Party Packages**:  \n   - Add `dexter_brain` to the project’s `requirements.txt`:  \n     ```txt  \n     dexter_brain==<version>  \n     ```  \n   - Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies and ensure consistency.  \n2. **For Local Packages**:  \n   - Structure the project to include `dexter_brain` as a subpackage.  \n   - Use `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` to declare it as an installable package.  \n   - Install the project in development mode:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install -e .  \n     ```  \n\n**Prevention**:  \n1. **Dependency Management**:  \n   - Use `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile` to track dependencies.  \n   - Automate dependency installation in CI/CD pipelines.  \n2. **Environment Isolation**:  \n   - Use virtual environments (e.g., `venv`) to avoid global Python pollution.  \n3. **Path Validation**:  \n   - Add checks in `main.py` to validate the presence of critical modules at startup.  \n4. **Monitoring**:  \n   - Implement logging for missing modules and set up alerts for startup failures.  \n\n**Risk Assessment**:  \n- **Risk Level**: LOW  \n  - Installing a missing module is low-risk if the package is trusted.  \n  - Adjusting `PYTHONPATH` or project structure has minimal impact if tested.  \n- **Confidence**: HIGH  \n  - The error is straightforward, and the solutions address common Python module issues.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Diagnose the Root Cause**:  \n   - Check if `dexter_brain` is installed or exists locally.  \n   - Validate the project structure and Python path.  \n2. **Implement Immediate Fix**:  \n   - Install the module or adjust the environment to locate it.  \n3. **Apply Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Integrate the module into the project’s dependency management system.  \n4. **Prevent Recurrence**:  \n   - Automate dependency checks and environment setup.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n**1. Check Installation**:  \n```bash  \n# Check if dexter_brain is installed  \npip show dexter_brain  \n\n# If missing, install it (replace with actual package name/version if known)  \npip install dexter_brain  \n```  \n\n**2. For Local Packages**:  \n- Ensure the project structure includes `dexter_brain` as a package:  \n  ```  \n  gliksbot/  \n  ├── backend/  \n  │   └── main.py  \n  └── dexter_brain/  \n      ├── __init__.py  \n      └── sandbox.py  \n  ```  \n- Install the project in development mode:  \n  ```bash  \n  cd M:\\gliksbot  \n  pip install -e .  \n  ```  \n\n**3. Update `requirements.txt`**:  \n```txt  \n# requirements.txt  \ndexter_brain==1.0.0  # Replace with actual version  \n```  \n\n**4. Add Path Validation to `main.py`**:  \n```python  \n# main.py (example check)  \nimport sys  \nfrom pathlib import Path  \n\n# Add project root to PYTHONPATH if missing  \nproject_root = Path(__file__).parent.parent  \nif str(project_root) not in sys.path:  \n    sys.path.append(str(project_root))  \n\n# Now import dexter_brain  \nfrom dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox  \n```  \n\n**5. Automate Dependency Checks**:  \n- Add a pre-startup script to verify dependencies:  \n  ```bash  \n  # check_dependencies.sh  \n  for package in $(cat requirements.txt | grep -v '^#'); do  \n    pip show $package || { echo \"Missing dependency: $package\"; exit 1; }  \n  done  \n  ```  \n\n**6. Monitor for Errors**:  \n- Use logging to capture missing modules:  \n  ```python  \n  import logging  \n  try:  \n      from dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox  \n  except ImportError as e:  \n      logging.critical(f\"Missing module: {e}\")  \n      raise  \n  ```  \n\n---\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (If Required)  \n**Skill**: Python Module Resolution & Dependency Management  \n**Code**:  \n```python  \n# Example: Dynamic path addition for local packages  \nimport sys  \nimport os  \nfrom pathlib import Path  \n\ndef add_project_root_to_path():  \n    \"\"\"Ensure the project root is in sys.path\"\"\"  \n    project_root = Path(__file__).parent.parent  \n    if str(project_root) not in sys.path:  \n        sys.path.insert(0, str(project_root))  \n\nadd_project_root_to_path()  \n```  \n\nThis ensures the project root is always in the module search path, resolving local package issues."
