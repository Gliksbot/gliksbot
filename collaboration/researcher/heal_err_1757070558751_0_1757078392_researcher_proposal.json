  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to parse through that first. The error is a STARTUP_ERROR with the message \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". The stack trace points to line 120 in main.py where it's trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nFirst, the root cause. The error is a ModuleNotFoundError for 'dexter_brain'. That usually means the module isn't installed in the Python environment. But since it's part of the system, maybe it's a missing dependency, or the environment isn't set up correctly. Alternatively, the module might be in a different directory not included in the Python path.\n\nLooking at the context, there's no context available, so I can't see if there were recent changes. But the system status shows 18 recent errors and 2 critical ones, with 2 related startup errors. That suggests this might be a recurring issue, possibly after some deployment or environment change.\n\nImmediate action: The user needs to check if the module exists. They should verify the installation of dexter_brain. If it's a package, maybe it's not installed. If it's a local module, the path might be incorrect. They could try installing it via pip if it's a third-party package, or ensure the directory is in the PYTHONPATH.\n\nPermanent fix: If the module is supposed to be part of the project, it should be included in the repository and installed as part of the setup. Maybe the setup.py or requirements.txt is missing it. They should add it to the dependencies and ensure it's installed in the correct environment. Also, checking the import statement to make sure it's correct.\n\nPrevention: Implement checks during deployment to ensure all dependencies are installed. Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies. Add monitoring to check for missing modules during startup. Maybe include a pre-start script that verifies all required modules are present.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing module could be medium if it's a third-party package with potential compatibility issues. If it's a local module, the risk is lower. The immediate action of installing might not disrupt operations if done correctly, but there's a chance of introducing new issues if the module isn't compatible.\n\nWait, but the error is in the system source, so maybe 'dexter_brain' is an internal module. If that's the case, the problem could be the project structure. The main.py is in M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\, but where is dexter_brain located? If it's in a sibling directory, the import might not work unless the parent directory is in the path. So the solution might involve adjusting the Python path in the startup script or moving the module to the correct location.\n\nSo, possible steps: Check if dexter_brain is present in the environment. If it's a local package, ensure it's in the right place and the import is correct. If it's a third-party package, install it. For permanent fix, structure the project so that all necessary modules are included and dependencies are managed properly.\n\nI should structure the analysis accordingly. The root cause is the missing module, which could be due to incorrect installation, path issues, or missing dependencies. Immediate action is to install or locate the module. Permanent fix involves ensuring the module is part of the project setup. Prevention through dependency management and monitoring.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to one of the following:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in a directory included in the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.  \n3. **Project Structure Issue**: The module is part of the project but not properly linked (e.g., missing `__init__.py` or incorrect import structure).  \n\nGiven the error occurs during startup and the system source is listed as \"system,\" this suggests a dependency or configuration issue in the deployment environment.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Immediate Action**:  \n   - Verify if `dexter_brain` is installed or available locally.  \n   - Temporarily adjust the Python path to include the module’s location.  \n   - Retry startup.  \n\n2. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Ensure `dexter_brain` is included in the project’s dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt` or `setup.py`).  \n   - Validate the project structure to ensure the module is accessible.  \n   - Automate dependency installation during deployment.  \n\n3. **Prevention**:  \n   - Implement dependency checks during deployment.  \n   - Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies.  \n   - Add monitoring for missing modules during startup.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### **Immediate_Action**  \n1. **Check for Module Installation**:  \n   Run the following command in the environment where the system is deployed:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip show dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If not found, proceed to install or locate the module.  \n\n2. **Temporarily Add Module Path**:  \n   If the module exists locally (e.g., in a sibling directory), modify the `main.py` script to add its path:  \n   ```python  \n   # Add this at the top of main.py (before the import)  \n   import sys  \n   sys.path.append(\"M:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\dexter_brain\")  \n   ```  \n\n3. **Retry Startup**:  \n   Restart the system after applying the above changes.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Permanent_Fix**  \n1. **Install Missing Dependency**:  \n   If `dexter_brain` is a third-party package:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If it’s a local/internal module:  \n   - Ensure it’s included in the project repository.  \n   - Install the project in development mode:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install -e .  \n     ```  \n\n2. **Update Project Structure**:  \n   - Confirm `dexter_brain` is in the same directory as `main.py` or a subdirectory with an `__init__.py` file.  \n   - Adjust imports to use relative paths if necessary.  \n\n3. **Automate Dependency Management**:  \n   Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` for future deployments:  \n   ```txt  \n   # requirements.txt  \n   dexter_brain==<version>  \n   ```  \n\n---\n\n#### **Prevention**  \n1. **Pre-Deployment Checks**:  \n   Add a script to validate dependencies before startup:  \n   ```python  \n   # check_dependencies.py  \n   import importlib.util  \n   required_modules = [\"dexter_brain\"]  \n   for module in required_modules:  \n       if not importlib.util.find_spec(module):  \n           raise ModuleNotFoundError(f\"Missing required module: {module}\")  \n   ```  \n\n2. **Monitoring**:  \n   - Log missing module errors during startup.  \n   - Set up alerts for `ModuleNotFoundError` in the system logs.  \n\n3. **Environment Isolation**:  \n   Use virtual environments (e.g., `venv`) to ensure consistent dependencies across deployments.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Risk Assessment**  \n- **Risk Level**: **MEDIUM**  \n  - Installing new packages could introduce compatibility issues.  \n  - Modifying `sys.path` temporarily may mask deeper project structure issues.  \n- **Confidence**: **HIGH**  \n  - The solution addresses the core issue of missing modules and ensures future prevention.  \n\n---\n\n### SKILL_SPEC (Optional)  \nIf the team lacks Python dependency management expertise, define a skill specification for onboarding:  \n```json  \n{  \n  \"skill\": \"Python Dependency Management\",  \n  \"description\": \"Ability to install, manage, and troubleshoot Python packages using pip, virtual environments, and project structures.\",  \n  \"tools\": [\"pip\", \"venv\", \"requirements.txt\", \"setup.py\"],  \n  \"tasks\": [\"Install packages\", \"Resolve import errors\", \"Automate dependency checks\"]  \n}  \n```  \n\nThis approach balances immediate resolution with long-term stability while minimizing operational disruption."
