The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That's a Python error, right? So the system is trying to import a module called dexter_brain, but it's not found. The traceback shows it's happening in main.py line 120 during the startup_event. The source is 'system', and it's a STARTUP_ERROR with critical severity. The system is in healing mode, so it's probably trying to boot up but failing because of this missing module.\n\nLooking at the context, there's no context available, which might mean that the error occurred early in the startup process before any context could be logged. The stack trace is straightforward: the import statement is failing.\n\nNow, the mission is to diagnose and provide healing solutions. The analysis required has five parts: root cause, immediate action, permanent fix, prevention, and risk assessment.\n\nStarting with root cause. The most common reason for a ModuleNotFoundError in Python is that the module isn't installed in the current environment, or it's not in the Python path. Alternatively, maybe the module is supposed to be part of the project but isn't included in the repository or isn't properly structured. Since the error occurs during startup, it's likely that the dexter_brain module is a dependency that's missing.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if the module exists. If it's a third-party package, installing it via pip. If it's a local module, ensuring it's in the right directory and that the Python path includes that directory. But since the error is in the backend code, maybe the module is part of the project but not properly linked.\n\nPermanent fix would involve ensuring that the module is included in the project's dependencies, either by installing it if it's external or by adding it to the source tree if it's internal. Also, setting up proper environment setup instructions so that when the environment is recreated, the module is present.\n\nPrevention could involve adding checks during deployment to ensure all dependencies are installed, using virtual environments, or containerization like Docker to ensure consistent environments. Also, monitoring for missing modules during startup.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing module could be low if it's a known package, but if it's a custom module, there might be versioning issues. Also, changing the Python path might have unintended consequences if not done carefully.\n\nNow, considering the system status: there are 194 recent errors and 2 critical ones, with 2 related startup errors. So this might be a recurring issue. The system is under stress, so solutions should be quick but effective.\n\nThe user wants specific implementation steps. So for immediate action, checking if dexter_brain is a package that can be installed. If not, checking the file structure. For permanent fix, adding it to requirements.txt or the project structure. Prevention through CI/CD checks.\n\nWait, but how do I know if dexter_brain is a third-party module or part of the project? The name suggests it might be a custom module, maybe part of the same codebase. The error is in the backend's main.py, which is trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox. So perhaps the dexter_brain package is a local package that's not installed or not in the right location.\n\nIn Python, if the module is part of the project, it should be in a directory that's part of the Python path. If the project structure has a directory named dexter_brain in the same parent directory as the backend, then the import should work. But if the backend is run from a different directory, the path might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, the package might need to be installed in development mode. So the solution could involve adding the directory to PYTHONPATH or installing the package with pip install -e .\n\nBut the user's system is in healing mode, so maybe the environment is broken. The immediate action would be to check the environment. If the module is supposed to be there, maybe the virtual environment isn't activated, or the dependencies weren't installed.\n\nSo steps for immediate action:\n\n1. Check if dexter_brain is a local package or a third-party module.\n2. If third-party, install it using pip.\n3. If local, ensure it's in the correct directory and the Python path includes it.\n4. Restart the service.\n\nFor permanent fix:\n\n- Ensure that the setup.py or pyproject.toml includes dexter_brain as part of the package, or that the requirements.txt includes any necessary dependencies.\n- Use virtual environments and document the setup process.\n- Implement automated testing to check for missing modules during CI/CD.\n\nPrevention:\n\n- Use dependency management tools like pipenv or poetry.\n- Containerize the application to ensure consistent environments.\n- Monitor startup logs for missing modules and alert on errors.\n\nRisk level: Installing a missing module could introduce new issues if the module has dependencies or conflicts. If it's a local module, there's a risk of version mismatch. But overall, the risk is medium.\n\nConfidence: High, because the error is straightforward, but depends on the actual setup of the project.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required format.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that Python cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is a third-party dependency not installed in the current environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists locally but is not in the Python path.  \n3. **Project Structure Issue**: The module is part of the project but not properly linked (e.g., missing `__init__.py` or incorrect imports).  \n\n**Context**:  \n- The error occurs during startup (`startup_event`), suggesting the module is critical for initialization.  \n- No context is available, implying the error happens early in the bootstrapping process.  \n- High recent error count (194) suggests systemic instability, possibly due to environment misconfiguration.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Immediate Action**:  \n   - Verify if `dexter_brain` is a third-party package (e.g., via PyPI) or a local module.  \n   - If third-party, install it. If local, ensure it’s in the correct directory and accessible via `PYTHONPATH`.  \n   - Restart the service after resolution.  \n\n2. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Add `dexter_brain` to dependency management (e.g., `requirements.txt` or `setup.py`).  \n   - Ensure the project structure includes the module in a discoverable location.  \n   - Use virtual environments or containerization to enforce consistent environments.  \n\n3. **Prevention**:  \n   - Implement pre-startup checks for required modules.  \n   - Use CI/CD pipelines to validate dependencies during deployment.  \n   - Monitor for `ModuleNotFoundError` in logs and alert on occurrences.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### Immediate_Action  \n1. **Check Module Type**:  \n   - Run `pip show dexter_brain` to check if it’s installed.  \n   - If not found, search PyPI or project documentation to confirm if it’s a third-party package.  \n\n2. **Install or Link Module**:  \n   - If third-party:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install dexter_brain  \n     ```  \n   - If local:  \n     - Ensure the `dexter_brain` directory is at the same level as `main.py` or add its path:  \n       ```bash  \n       export PYTHONPATH=\"${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/dexter_brain\"  \n       ```  \n\n3. **Restart Service**:  \n   ```bash  \n   systemctl restart gliksbot-backend  \n   ```  \n\n#### Permanent_Fix  \n1. **Add to Dependencies**:  \n   - If third-party, add to `requirements.txt`:  \n     ```  \n     dexter_brain==<version>  \n     ```  \n   - If local, ensure `dexter_brain` is included in the project repository and installed via:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install -e .  \n     ```  \n\n2. **Environment Standardization**:  \n   - Use `Dockerfile` to containerize the app:  \n     ```dockerfile  \n     FROM python:3.9  \n     WORKDIR /app  \n     COPY requirements.txt .  \n     RUN pip install -r requirements.txt  \n     COPY . .  \n     CMD [\"python\", \"main.py\"]  \n     ```  \n\n#### Prevention  \n1. **Pre-Startup Check Script**:  \n   Create a script to validate dependencies:  \n   ```python  \n   # check_dependencies.py  \n   import importlib.util  \n   required = [\"dexter_brain\"]  \n   for module in required:  \n       if not importlib.util.find_spec(module):  \n           raise ModuleNotFoundError(f\"Missing module: {module}\")  \n   ```  \n   Run this before starting the service.  \n\n2. **CI/CD Integration**:  \n   Add a pipeline step to run `check_dependencies.py` during deployment.  \n\n#### Risk_Level: MEDIUM  \n- **Risk**: Installing unknown packages could introduce vulnerabilities or conflicts.  \n- **Mitigation**: Verify package integrity and use virtual environments.  \n\n#### Confidence: HIGH  \n- The solution addresses the most common causes of `ModuleNotFoundError` and aligns with Python best practices.  \n\n--- \n\n### SKILL_SPEC (Optional)  \nIf the team lacks Python environment management skills, provide training on:  \n- Virtual environments (`venv`)  \n- Dependency management (`pip`, `requirements.txt`)  \n- Containerization (`Docker`)  \n\nExample `requirements.txt` entry for clarity:  \n```  \n# requirements.txt  \ndexter_brain>=1.0.0  \n```  \n\nThis approach balances rapid resolution with long-term stability."
