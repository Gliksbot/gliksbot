  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The traceback shows it's happening in main.py line 120 during the startup event. The system is trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox but failing.\n\nLooking at the error details, it's a STARTUP_ERROR of CRITICAL severity. The source is the system itself, and there have been 15 recent errors with 2 critical ones. The related startup errors are 2, so this might have happened before.\n\nThe mission is to diagnose and provide solutions. The analysis needs root cause, immediate action, permanent fix, prevention, and risk assessment.\n\nRoot cause: The most likely reason is that the 'dexter_brain' module isn't installed or not in the Python path. Alternatively, there might be a typo in the module name, or the package isn't properly structured. Since the error is during startup, it's possible that the module isn't present in the environment where the application is running.\n\nImmediate action: The user needs to check if the module exists. If it's a local module, maybe it's not in the right directory. If it's a package, they might need to install it via pip. Restarting the service after fixing the path or installing the package could help. Also, checking the Python environment to ensure it's the correct one.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure the module is properly installed or linked. If it's a third-party package, add it to requirements.txt. If it's a local module, make sure the directory is included in PYTHONPATH. Maybe setting up a virtual environment with all dependencies.\n\nPrevention: Implement dependency checks during deployment, use virtual environments, monitor for missing modules, and have automated tests that check imports. Also, version control for the modules to ensure consistency.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of immediate actions like installing packages might be low if done in a controlled environment. Permanent fixes like changing environment setups could have medium risk if not tested properly.\n\nNow, considering the user's request for a solution approach. They might need specific commands to check the Python path, install the package, or adjust the environment variables. Also, checking if the module name is correct.\n\nWait, the error is 'No module named 'dexter_brain'', which suggests that Python is looking for a package named dexter_brain. If this is a custom module, it should be in the same directory as main.py or in a directory listed in PYTHONPATH. If it's a third-party package, it needs to be installed.\n\nSo possible steps:\n\n1. Check if dexter_brain is installed. If not, install it via pip.\n2. If it's a local module, ensure the directory is in the Python path.\n3. Check for typos in the import statement.\n4. Verify the Python environment being used.\n\nFor the implementation, the user might need commands like pip install dexter_brain (if applicable), or adding the path in the code or environment variables.\n\nBut since the error is in the backend's main.py, maybe the dexter_brain is part of the project structure. So the directory structure might be missing, or the package isn't properly installed in development mode.\n\nIn that case, the solution could involve installing the package in development mode using pip install -e . if it's a local package.\n\nAlternatively, if the module is supposed to be there but isn't due to a deployment issue, then checking the deployment process to ensure all necessary files are included.\n\nPrevention would involve ensuring that all dependencies are listed and installed during deployment, using virtual environments, and having CI/CD checks for missing modules.\n\nRisk level for immediate actions like installing packages is low if done correctly. Permanent fixes might involve changing environment setups, which could have medium risk if not handled properly.\n\nSo putting this all together into the required sections.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that Python cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This typically occurs due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect directory structure or missing `__init__.py`).  \n3. **Typo/Mismatch**: A typo in the module name or version mismatch between development and deployment environments.  \n\n**Contextual Factors**:  \n- The error occurs during startup (`startup_event`), suggesting a dependency failure early in the application lifecycle.  \n- No context is available, implying potential gaps in deployment logging or environment configuration.  \n- High recent error count (15) and critical errors (2) suggest systemic instability, possibly due to unresolved dependency issues.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n**Immediate Action**:  \n1. **Verify Module Existence**:  \n   - Check if `dexter_brain` is installed in the current environment:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip show dexter_brain  \n     ```  \n   - If missing, install it (if it’s a third-party package) or ensure it’s included in the project directory.  \n2. **Check Python Path**:  \n   - Confirm the module’s location is in the Python path. Temporarily add it during runtime:  \n     ```python  \n     import sys  \n     sys.path.append(\"M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\backend\\\\path_to_dexter_brain\")  \n     ```  \n3. **Restart Service**:  \n   - After fixes, restart the backend service to apply changes.  \n\n**Permanent Fix**:  \n1. **Install Dependencies**:  \n   - If `dexter_brain` is a third-party package, add it to `requirements.txt`:  \n     ```txt  \n     dexter_brain==<version>  \n     ```  \n   - Install dependencies in a virtual environment:  \n     ```bash  \n     python -m venv venv  \n     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate  \n     pip install -r requirements.txt  \n     ```  \n2. **Project Structure**:  \n   - If `dexter_brain` is a local module, ensure it’s in the same directory as `main.py` or add its path to `PYTHONPATH`:  \n     ```bash  \n     set PYTHONPATH=M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\backend\\\\dexter_brain;%PYTHONPATH%  \n     ```  \n\n**Prevention**:  \n1. **Automated Dependency Checks**:  \n   - Integrate a pre-startup script to validate required modules:  \n     ```bash  \n     # check_dependencies.sh  \n     python -c \"import dexter_brain\" || { echo \"Missing dexter_brain\"; exit 1; }  \n     ```  \n2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:  \n   - Add a test step to verify all imports in `main.py`.  \n3. **Environment Consistency**:  \n   - Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to lock dependencies and ensure parity between dev and production.  \n\n**Risk Assessment**:  \n- **Immediate Action Risk**: Low (manual path addition is temporary and reversible).  \n- **Permanent Fix Risk**: Medium (environment changes require testing to avoid breaking other dependencies).  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n**Skill Specification (if required)**:  \nIf `dexter_brain` is a custom module, ensure it follows Python package conventions:  \n```  \ndexter_brain/  \n├── __init__.py  \n├── sandbox.py  \n└── ...  \n```  \n\n**Code Snippet for Dependency Validation**:  \nAdd this to `main.py` before the problematic import:  \n```python  \ntry:  \n    import dexter_brain  \nexcept ImportError:  \n    raise RuntimeError(\"Critical dependency 'dexter_brain' is missing. Install it or check PYTHONPATH.\")  \n```  \n\n**Commands for Deployment**:  \n```bash  \n# Install dependencies  \npip install -r requirements.txt  \n\n# Set PYTHONPATH (Windows example)  \nset PYTHONPATH=M:\\gliksbot\\backend  \n\n# Run application  \npython main.py  \n```  \n\n**Monitoring**:  \n- Use tools like Prometheus or Sentry to alert on `ModuleNotFoundError` occurrences.  \n- Log Python path and environment details during startup for debugging.  \n\n--- \n\n**Confidence**: HIGH (solution addresses common causes of module import errors).  \n**Risk Level**: LOW for immediate actions, MEDIUM for permanent fixes (requires testing)."
