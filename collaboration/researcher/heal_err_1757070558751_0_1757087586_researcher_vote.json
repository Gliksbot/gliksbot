  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The traceback shows it's happening in main.py line 120 during the startup_event. The module in question is dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nLooking at the system status, there are recent errors, including two startup errors. The source is the system itself, so it's a core component. The mission is to diagnose and fix this.\n\nRoot cause analysis: The most likely reason is that the dexter_brain module isn't installed or not in the Python path. Alternatively, there might be a typo in the import statement, but the error message suggests the module isn't found. Since the error is during startup, it's possible the module isn't installed in the environment where the backend is running.\n\nImmediate action: Check if the module exists in the environment. If it's a local module, maybe it's not in the right directory. If it's a package, maybe it's not installed. The user might need to install it via pip or ensure the PYTHONPATH includes the directory where dexter_brain is located. Alternatively, if the module is part of the project, maybe the structure changed, and the import is incorrect.\n\nPermanent fix: Install the missing module. If it's a third-party package, install it using pip. If it's a local module, ensure it's in the correct location and the project structure is correct. Also, check the import statement for any typos. Maybe the module was moved or renamed, so the import needs to be updated.\n\nPrevention: Implement checks during deployment to ensure all required modules are installed. Use a requirements.txt file and verify dependencies. Also, set up monitoring to alert when startup errors occur, and maybe run a linter or import checker as part of the build process.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing module is low if it's a known package. However, if the module is not supposed to be there, there might be a configuration issue. The confidence in the solution depends on whether the module is indeed missing or if there's another underlying issue.\n\nWait, but the error is in the system's own code. So dexter_brain might be a custom module part of the project. If that's the case, the problem could be that the module isn't in the Python path. The backend might be running from a different directory, so the relative imports are broken. Alternatively, the module might have been deleted or moved.\n\nSo possible steps: Check the file structure to ensure dexter_brain is present. If it's missing, restore it from version control or backups. If it's present but not in the right place, adjust the import or the directory structure. Also, check the PYTHONPATH environment variable to include the project root.\n\nAnother angle: The error occurs during startup, so maybe the module is installed but not in the correct environment. For example, if using virtual environments, the module might be installed in the global environment instead of the project's virtualenv.\n\nImmediate action steps: Check if dexter_brain is installed (pip list | grep dexter_brain), if not, install it. If it's a local module, check the directory structure and adjust sys.path if necessary. For a quick fix, maybe add the directory to sys.path in main.py before the import.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure that the module is properly installed or included in the project structure. If it's a package, include it in setup.py or requirements.txt. If it's part of the codebase, make sure the imports are correct and the file structure is maintained.\n\nPrevention: Use dependency management tools, automate checks for missing modules during CI/CD, and ensure that the environment setup documentation is accurate.\n\nRisk level: Low to medium. Installing a missing module is generally safe, but if the module has dependencies or conflicts, there could be issues. Confidence is high if the module is known to be required and missing.\n\nSo putting it all together, the root cause is the missing module. Immediate action is to install or locate the module. Permanent fix is to ensure it's part of the environment. Prevention involves better dependency management.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect directory structure or missing `__init__.py`).  \n3. A typo or misconfiguration in the import statement (unlikely here, as the error explicitly names `dexter_brain`).  \n\nGiven the context (system startup and lack of module), the root cause is most likely **missing installation or incorrect environment configuration**.  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. **Verify module existence**: Check if `dexter_brain` is a local module (e.g., exists in the project directory) or a third-party package.  \n2. **If third-party**: Install it via pip:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter-brain  # or the correct package name  \n   ```  \n3. **If local module**:  \n   - Ensure the directory containing `dexter_brain` is in the Python path.  \n   - Temporarily add the path in `main.py` (before the import):  \n     ```python  \n     import sys  \n     sys.path.append(\"M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\path_to_dexter_brain\")  \n     ```  \n4. **Check environment**: Confirm the correct Python environment is active (e.g., virtualenv).  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. **For third-party modules**: Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` and ensure it is installed during deployment.  \n2. **For local modules**:  \n   - Structure the project to include `dexter_brain` in a standardized location (e.g., `src/`).  \n   - Use relative imports or adjust `setup.py` to include the module in the package.  \n   - Example `setup.py` snippet:  \n     ```python  \n     from setuptools import setup  \n     setup(  \n         packages=[\"dexter_brain\"],  \n         package_dir={\"\": \"path_to_dexter_brain\"}  \n     )  \n     ```  \n\nPrevention:  \n- Implement automated dependency checks in CI/CD pipelines (e.g., `pip check` after installation).  \n- Use tools like `pyproject.toml` or `poetry` for deterministic dependency management.  \n- Monitor startup logs for `ModuleNotFoundError` and alert on occurrences.  \n\nRisk_Level: **LOW** (Installing a missing module is low-risk if the module is trusted and version-compatible).  \nConfidence: **HIGH** (The error is straightforward and commonly resolved by ensuring module availability).  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
