  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a startup error because the module 'dexter_brain' isn't found. The error message is pretty clear: ModuleNotFoundError. So the first thing I need to figure out is why Python can't find that module.\n\nLooking at the context, the error occurs in main.py when trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox. The system is trying to start up, so maybe the module isn't installed or isn't in the right directory. Let me think about possible causes.\n\nFirst, the module might not be installed. If 'dexter_brain' is a package that needs to be installed via pip or some other method, maybe it's missing. Alternatively, if it's a local module, the Python path might not include the directory where it's located. Another possibility is that the module is installed but in a different environment. For example, if the system is using a virtual environment, but the module isn't installed there.\n\nThe stack trace shows the file path as M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\main.py. So the project is in M:\\gliksbot. The 'dexter_brain' module should be in the same directory or a subdirectory that's part of the Python path. If it's a separate package, maybe it's not in the right place.\n\nImmediate actions would be to check if the module exists in the expected location. The user should verify the file structure. If it's a local module, maybe the directory isn't added to sys.path. Alternatively, if it's a package, installing it via pip might be necessary.\n\nFor a permanent fix, ensuring that the module is properly installed or that the Python path includes the correct directories. If it's a third-party package, installing it. If it's a local module, maybe adjusting the setup to include it in the package structure or modifying the sys.path in the code.\n\nPrevention could involve setting up proper dependency management, using virtual environments, and ensuring that all required modules are included in the project's setup. Also, adding checks during the startup to verify that all necessary modules are present.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing package might be low if it's a known and trusted package. However, if the module is supposed to be part of the project, there might be a configuration issue. Modifying the Python path could have unintended consequences if not done carefully.\n\nSo putting this all together, the root cause is likely that the 'dexter_brain' module isn't installed or isn't in the Python path. Immediate action would be to check the installation or file structure. Permanent fix would involve installing the package or adjusting the project structure. Prevention through dependency management and environment setup. Risk level is medium because if the module is not properly handled, it could lead to other issues, but the solution is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because Python cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. The module is not installed in the current Python environment  \n2. The module's directory is not in the Python path  \n3. The module file is missing or misnamed  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' is a local module: Check if `dexter_brain.py` or a `dexter_brain/` directory exists in `M:\\gliksbot\\backend` or its subdirectories  \n2. If missing, restore from version control or backup  \n3. If present but not recognized, add the directory to Python path:  \n   ```python\n   import sys\n   sys.path.append('M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\backend')  # Add before import\n   ```  \n4. If it's a package, install via pip:  \n   ```bash\n   pip install dexter_brain\n   ```  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. If local module:  \n   - Ensure `dexter_brain` is in a directory listed in `sys.path`  \n   - Create `__init__.py` in `dexter_brain/` if missing  \n   - Update project setup to include package in distribution  \n2. If external package:  \n   - Add to `requirements.txt`  \n   - Install in virtual environment:  \n     ```bash\n     python -m venv venv\n     source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\\Scripts\\activate on Windows\n     pip install -r requirements.txt\n     ```  \n\nPrevention:  \n- Implement dependency checks in startup script:  \n  ```python\n  try:\n      import dexter_brain\n  except ImportError:\n      print(\"CRITICAL: dexter_brain module missing\")\n      # Trigger alert/notification\n  ```  \n- Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to maintain dependencies  \n- Add CI/CD pipeline checks for module availability  \n\nRisk_Level: MEDIUM  \n- Risk of environment misconfiguration if path modifications are not standardized  \n- Potential version conflicts if package installation isn't controlled  \n\nConfidence: HIGH  \n- Solution addresses all common causes of ModuleNotFoundError  \n- Steps are standard Python troubleshooting practices  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
