  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user provided a detailed error message: \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". So the system is failing to start because it can't find this module.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out why that module isn't found. Common reasons for ModuleNotFoundError are that the module isn't installed, there's a typo in the name, or the Python path isn't set correctly.\n\nLooking at the context, the error occurs in main.py line 120 when trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox. The system is in the backend directory. Maybe the module isn't installed in the current environment. Or perhaps the module is part of the project but not properly included in the Python path.\n\nImmediate actions would be to check if the module exists. If it's a third-party package, installing it via pip would help. If it's a local module, ensuring that the directory containing dexter_brain is in the Python path. Alternatively, maybe the virtual environment isn't activated, so the installed packages aren't available.\n\nFor a permanent fix, if the module is a dependency, adding it to requirements.txt and ensuring it's installed in the environment. If it's a local module, adjusting the sys.path in the code or structuring the project so that the module is in a directory that's part of the package structure.\n\nPrevention could involve setting up proper dependency management, using virtual environments, and maybe adding checks during the startup to verify required modules are present. Also, monitoring for missing modules in the logs.\n\nRisks of the solution: If installing a package, there might be version conflicts. If modifying the Python path, it could lead to unexpected behavior if not done correctly. So the risk level might be medium.\n\nConfidence in the solution depends on correctly identifying whether the module is a third-party or local. Since the error is during startup, it's likely a missing dependency or incorrect environment setup.\n\nSo putting it all together: The root cause is the missing module. Immediate action is to install it or adjust the path. Permanent fix is ensuring dependencies are managed. Prevention through better dependency tracking. Risk is medium, confidence high if the steps are followed.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because Python cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. The module is not installed in the current Python environment  \n2. The module exists but is not in the Python path  \n3. There's a typo/mismatch in the module name  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' is a local module or third-party package  \n2. If third-party: Run `pip install dexter_brain` (or specific version if required)  \n3. If local:  \n   a. Confirm the module exists in the project directory structure  \n   b. Add the parent directory to PYTHONPATH:  \n      ```bash  \n      set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;M:\\gliksbot\\backend  \n      ```  \n   c. Or modify sys.path in main.py before the import:  \n      ```python  \n      import sys  \n      sys.path.append(\"M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\backend\")  \n      ```  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. If third-party: Add to requirements.txt:  \n   ```  \n   dexter_brain==X.Y.Z  # Specific version  \n   ```  \n   Ensure virtual environment is activated during deployment  \n\n2. If local:  \n   a. Structure project as a package with proper __init__.py files  \n   b. Install locally using:  \n      ```bash  \n      pip install -e .  \n      ```  \n   c. Or modify project layout to ensure dexter_brain is in a standard location  \n\nPrevention:  \n1. Implement dependency checks in startup script:  \n   ```python  \n   try:  \n       import dexter_brain  \n   except ImportError:  \n       logger.error(\"Missing required module: dexter_brain\")  \n       # Send alert or trigger installation  \n   ```  \n2. Use virtual environment with pinned dependencies  \n3. Add CI/CD pipeline checks for module availability  \n4. Monitor for ModuleNotFoundError patterns in logs  \n\nRisk_Level: MEDIUM  \n- Risk of version conflicts if installing packages  \n- Path modifications could mask deeper structural issues  \n\nConfidence: HIGH  \n- Solution addresses all common causes of ModuleNotFoundError  \n- Steps are standard Python troubleshooting practices  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
