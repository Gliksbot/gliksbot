  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a STARTUP_ERROR because the module 'dexter_brain' isn't found. First, I need to figure out why that module is missing.\n\nRoot cause: The error message says \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means the package isn't installed in the Python environment. Alternatively, maybe the code is looking for it in the wrong directory, or there's a typo in the import statement. But given the context, the most likely cause is that the package isn't installed.\n\nImmediate action: The user needs to install the missing module. But wait, is 'dexter_brain' a third-party package or a local one? If it's a local module, maybe the file structure is wrong. But since the error is during startup, and the path is M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\main.py, perhaps 'dexter_brain' is a package that should be in the same directory or a subdirectory. Alternatively, it might be a package that needs to be installed via pip. The user should check if 'dexter_brain' is supposed to be a local module or an external one. If it's external, installing it via pip would help. If it's local, they need to ensure the directory is in the Python path.\n\nLooking at the stack trace, the import is from 'dexter_brain.sandbox', so the module 'dexter_brain' should be present. If the project structure has 'dexter_brain' as a subdirectory with an __init__.py file, then the import should work. But if that directory is missing or not in the right place, the error occurs.\n\nSo possible immediate actions: Check if 'dexter_brain' is installed or present in the project. If it's a local package, maybe the working directory is incorrect. The user could try running the script from the parent directory of 'dexter_brain' so that Python can find it. Alternatively, install the package if it's a dependency.\n\nPermanent fix: If it's a missing package, install it. If it's a local module, ensure the directory structure is correct and the module is included. Also, check the Python path settings. Maybe adding the directory to PYTHONPATH would help. Or using a virtual environment where all dependencies are installed.\n\nPrevention: Implement dependency management, like a requirements.txt file that includes 'dexter_brain' if it's an external package. Or ensure that the project structure is correctly set up with proper imports. Also, setting up CI/CD pipelines to check for missing modules during testing.\n\nRisk assessment: Installing a package might introduce conflicts if it's not the correct version. If 'dexter_brain' is a local module, moving files around could cause other issues. So the risk is medium if the solution involves installing a third-party package, but low if it's just adjusting the file structure.\n\nConfidence: High, because the error is a straightforward ModuleNotFoundError, which usually has a clear solution.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRoot cause: Missing 'dexter_brain' module, either not installed or not in the correct location.\n\nImmediate action: Check if 'dexter_brain' is a local module. If yes, ensure the directory is in the Python path. If not, install it via pip. Alternatively, check the project structure and file paths.\n\nPermanent fix: Install the required package or adjust the project structure to include the module. Update dependencies in requirements.txt if applicable.\n\nPrevention: Use virtual environments, dependency management, and automated tests to catch missing modules.\n\nRisk level: Medium, because installing a package could have version conflicts, but adjusting the file structure is low risk.\n\nConfidence: High.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because the Python interpreter cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons: (1) the module is not installed in the current Python environment, (2) the module's directory is not in the Python path, or (3) the module file/directory is missing or misnamed.  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' is a local module: Check if a directory named `dexter_brain` exists in `M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\` or its subdirectories. If present, ensure it contains an `__init__.py` file.  \n2. If missing, restore the module from version control or backups.  \n3. If it's a third-party dependency, install it via pip:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n4. If the module exists but is in a non-standard location, temporarily add its path to `PYTHONPATH`:  \n   ```bash  \n   set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;M:\\path\\to\\dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n- **Option 1 (Local Module):** Ensure the project structure includes `dexter_brain` as a package in the correct directory (e.g., `M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\dexter_brain\\`) with `__init__.py`.  \n- **Option 2 (Third-Party):** Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` and install in a virtual environment:  \n  ```bash  \n  pip install -r requirements.txt  \n  ```  \n- **Option 3 (Relative Import):** Modify the import statement in `main.py` to use relative imports if `dexter_brain` is part of the same package.  \n\nPrevention:  \n- Use a `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile` to manage dependencies.  \n- Implement a pre-startup script to validate module availability.  \n- Add CI/CD checks to ensure all imports resolve during testing.  \n- Monitor for `ModuleNotFoundError` in logs and trigger alerts.  \n\nRisk_Level: MEDIUM (Installing third-party packages may introduce version conflicts; file structure changes could affect other modules).  \nConfidence: HIGH (Solution addresses common causes of missing module errors).  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
