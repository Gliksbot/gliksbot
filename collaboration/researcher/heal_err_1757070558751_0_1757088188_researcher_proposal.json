  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to parse through that first. The error is a STARTUP_ERROR with the message \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". The stack trace points to main.py trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nHmm, the root cause here is probably a missing module. The system can't find the 'dexter_brain' package when starting up. That could be due to a few reasons: the package isn't installed, it's not in the right directory, or there's an issue with the Python path.\n\nLooking at the context, there's no context available, so I can't see if there were recent changes. But the error is critical and happening on startup. The immediate action would be to check if the module exists in the environment. If it's a local package, maybe it's not installed properly. If it's a third-party package, maybe it wasn't installed via pip.\n\nFor the permanent fix, ensuring that the module is correctly installed and available in the Python environment. If it's a custom module, maybe the directory structure is wrong, or the __init__.py files are missing. Also, checking the PYTHONPATH environment variable to make sure the directory containing dexter_brain is included.\n\nPrevention would involve setting up checks in the CI/CD pipeline to verify all dependencies are installed. Maybe adding a pre-start script that checks for required modules. Also, monitoring for missing modules during deployment.\n\nRisk assessment: The immediate action of installing the package is low risk if done correctly. The permanent fix might involve changing environment configurations, which could have medium risk if not tested properly. But since the system is in healing mode, quick action is needed.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that the error is from the 'system' source. Maybe the dexter_brain module is part of the internal system, so it's not a third-party package. That would mean the module is missing from the project's repository or not properly linked. So the solution might involve restoring the module from version control, or reinstalling the project dependencies.\n\nAlso, checking if there's a typo in the module name. But the error message says 'dexter_brain' exactly, so probably not a typo. The file path in the stack trace is M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\main.py, so the main.py is in the backend directory. The dexter_brain module should be in the same parent directory as backend, or in a location that's part of the Python path.\n\nSo possible steps: Check if dexter_brain exists in the project directory. If not, restore it from backups or version control. If it's there, check if the Python path includes that directory. Maybe the backend directory is not in the PYTHONPATH, so adding it.\n\nAlternatively, if the module is supposed to be installed as a package, maybe the setup.py is missing or not run. So running python setup.py install could help.\n\nBut since the user is looking for immediate actions, the first step would be to check the presence of the module. If it's missing, install or restore it. If it's present, check the import path.\n\nIn terms of implementation, the immediate action would be to verify the existence of the dexter_brain directory in the project root, then ensure it's in the Python path. If not, add it via sys.path.append or set PYTHONPATH environment variable.\n\nPermanent fix would be to structure the project so that dexter_brain is properly included, maybe by adjusting the setup.py to include it as a package, or modifying the project structure to follow standard Python practices.\n\nPrevention could involve adding a check in the startup script to validate all required modules are present before proceeding, and logging a warning if any are missing.\n\nRisk level for immediate action is low if just checking and adding paths, but higher if modifying environment variables without testing. Confidence is high because the error is straightforward once the module is located.\n\nSo putting this all together into the required sections.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**: The error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This typically occurs due to:  \n1. Missing installation of the module (if it’s a third-party package).  \n2. Incorrect project structure (e.g., `dexter_brain` directory not in the Python path).  \n3. Missing `__init__.py` files in the module directory.  \n4. Environment misconfiguration (e.g., wrong Python environment or `PYTHONPATH`).  \n\nGiven the context, `dexter_brain` is likely a custom module within the project. The error suggests it is either missing, not properly installed, or not in the correct directory.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Immediate Action**:  \n   - Verify the existence of the `dexter_brain` directory in the project root (`M:\\gliksbot\\`).  \n   - Check if `dexter_brain` is listed in `setup.py` (if applicable) or installed as a package.  \n   - Temporarily add the project root to the Python path in `main.py` to resolve the import.  \n\n2. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Ensure `dexter_brain` is properly structured as a Python package (includes `__init__.py`).  \n   - Install the project in development mode (`pip install -e .`) to make modules globally accessible.  \n   - Update the project’s `setup.py` to include `dexter_brain` as a package.  \n\n3. **Prevention**:  \n   - Add a pre-startup script to validate module availability.  \n   - Implement CI/CD checks to ensure all dependencies are installed and imports resolve.  \n   - Monitor `PYTHONPATH` and environment variables during deployment.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### Immediate_Action  \n1. **Check Project Structure**:  \n   ```bash\n   # Navigate to project root\n   cd M:\\gliksbot\n   # Verify dexter_brain exists\n   dir\n   ```  \n   If missing, restore from backups or version control.  \n\n2. **Temporarily Modify `main.py`**:  \n   Add the project root to `sys.path` at the top of `main.py`:  \n   ```python\n   import sys\n   import os\n   sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..')))\n   ```  \n\n3. **Test Startup**:  \n   ```bash\n   python M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\main.py\n   ```  \n\n#### Permanent_Fix  \n1. **Structure `dexter_brain` as a Package**:  \n   Ensure `dexter_brain` contains an `__init__.py` file (even empty).  \n\n2. **Update `setup.py`**:  \n   Add `dexter_brain` to the `packages` list:  \n   ```python\n   from setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\n   setup(\n       name='gliksbot',\n       packages=find_packages(),  # Automatically includes all directories with __init__.py\n       # OR explicitly list packages:\n       # packages=['dexter_brain', 'backend'],\n   )\n   ```  \n\n3. **Install in Development Mode**:  \n   ```bash\n   cd M:\\gliksbot\n   pip install -e .\n   ```  \n\n#### Prevention  \n1. **Add Pre-Startup Check**:  \n   Create a script `prestart.py` to validate imports:  \n   ```python\n   try:\n       import dexter_brain\n       print(\"Module dexter_brain found.\")\n   except ImportError:\n       print(\"ERROR: Module dexter_brain missing. Exiting.\")\n       exit(1)\n   ```  \n   Run this before starting the application.  \n\n2. **CI/CD Integration**:  \n   Add a test in CI pipelines to ensure all imports resolve:  \n   ```bash\n   # Example in GitHub Actions\n   - name: Validate imports\n     run: |\n       python -c \"import dexter_brain\"\n   ```  \n\n#### Risk_Level  \n- **Immediate Action**: LOW (temporary path modification is safe for testing).  \n- **Permanent Fix**: MEDIUM (requires testing after `setup.py` changes).  \n\n#### Confidence  \nHIGH (solution addresses common Python import issues and aligns with standard practices).  \n\n--- \n\n### SKILL_SPEC (Optional)  \nIf the team lacks Python packaging expertise, define a skill:  \n```json\n{\n  \"skill\": \"Python Package Management\",\n  \"description\": \"Ability to structure Python projects, create packages, and manage dependencies via setuptools.\",\n  \"resources\": [\n    \"https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/\",\n    \"https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
