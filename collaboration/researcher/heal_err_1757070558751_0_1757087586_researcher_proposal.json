  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That's a Python import error. The system is trying to import a module called dexter_brain, but it's not found. The traceback points to line 120 in main.py where it's trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nSo, the root cause here is likely that the dexter_brain module isn't installed or isn't in the Python path. Maybe it's a missing package, or the environment isn't set up correctly. Since it's a startup error, the module is required for the application to start.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if the module exists. If it's a third-party package, installing it via pip might help. If it's a local module, ensuring it's in the right directory and the Python path includes that directory. Also, checking the virtual environment if one is being used.\n\nFor a permanent fix, the module should be properly installed or linked. If it's part of the project, maybe adding it to the setup.py or requirements.txt. Also, ensuring that the environment variables are set correctly so that Python can find the module.\n\nPrevention would involve setting up monitoring to check for missing modules during deployment, maybe automated tests that check imports, or using dependency management tools. Also, ensuring that the CI/CD pipeline includes installing all required packages.\n\nRisk assessment: The immediate action of installing a package could have risks if the package isn't trusted or has compatibility issues. But since the error is critical, it's necessary. The permanent fix of adding to requirements.txt is low risk.\n\nNow, considering the user's response format, I need to structure the answer into Analysis, Immediate Action, Permanent Fix, Prevention, Risk Level, and Confidence. Also, the special considerations mention prioritizing solutions that don't disrupt operations, so maybe checking the environment first before installing anything.\n\nWait, but how do I know if dexter_brain is a third-party module or part of the project? The error is in the backend code, so maybe it's a custom module. If the code is in the same repository, perhaps the directory structure changed, or the module isn't included in the build. Alternatively, if it's a package that needs to be installed, maybe it's not in the requirements.\n\nSo, possible steps: Check if dexter_brain is present in the project directory. If it's there, check if it's in the Python path. If not, add it. If it's a package, install it. Also, check virtual environments.\n\nIn the immediate action, the user should verify the presence of the module, then install or adjust the path. For permanent fix, ensure that the setup includes the module, maybe via pip install -e if it's a local package, or adding to requirements.\n\nPrevention could involve adding checks in the deployment process to ensure all dependencies are met, maybe using linters or import checkers in CI.\n\nRisk level for immediate action: medium, because installing a package could introduce new issues. Confidence might be high if the module is known to be required.\n\nI need to make sure the steps are concrete. For example, specific commands to check the module, install it, etc. Also, considering that the system is in healing mode, so the solution should be quick and safe.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the module name is misspelled? But the error says 'dexter_brain' exactly, so probably not. Or the case is different, but Python is case-sensitive. So if the directory is named differently, that could be an issue.\n\nSo, the analysis should cover these possibilities. The immediate action would be to check the module's existence and install if needed. Permanent fix is ensuring it's part of the dependencies. Prevention through automated checks.\n</think>\n\n# Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that Python cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to:  \n1. Missing installation of the `dexter_brain` package (if it’s a third-party dependency).  \n2. Incorrect Python path configuration (if `dexter_brain` is a local/custom module not included in the environment’s `PYTHONPATH`).  \n3. A broken or misconfigured virtual environment.  \n\n**Context**:  \nThe error occurs during the `startup_event` in `main.py`, suggesting `dexter_brain` is critical for initialization. The absence of context implies this may be a deployment or environment-specific issue.  \n\n---\n\n# Approach  \n1. **Verify Module Existence**:  \n   - Check if `dexter_brain` is a local module (e.g., a directory with `__init__.py`) or a third-party package.  \n   - Confirm its presence in the project directory or Python environment.  \n\n2. **Immediate Mitigation**:  \n   - Install the module if missing (via `pip` or building from source).  \n   - Adjust `PYTHONPATH` if the module is local but not in the standard paths.  \n\n3. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Add `dexter_brain` to dependency management (e.g., `requirements.txt` or `setup.py`).  \n   - Ensure environment setup scripts (e.g., Dockerfiles, CI/CD pipelines) include the module.  \n\n4. **Prevention**:  \n   - Implement dependency checks during deployment.  \n   - Use linters (e.g., `pylint`, `flake8`) to validate imports.  \n   - Monitor for missing modules in CI pipelines.  \n\n---\n\n# Implementation  \n\n### Immediate_Action  \n1. **Check for Local Module**:  \n   ```bash  \n   # Navigate to the project root  \n   cd M:\\gliksbot\\backend  \n   # Check if dexter_brain exists as a directory  \n   dir | findstr \"dexter_brain\"  \n   ```  \n   If found, ensure it contains an `__init__.py` file.  \n\n2. **Install Missing Package**:  \n   ```bash  \n   # If dexter_brain is a third-party package  \n   pip install dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If the package is internal or not on PyPI:  \n   ```bash  \n   # Install from local source (adjust path as needed)  \n   pip install -e ..\\dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n\n3. **Adjust PYTHONPATH (if local module)**:  \n   ```bash  \n   # Add the directory containing dexter_brain to PYTHONPATH  \n   set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;M:\\gliksbot\\  \n   python main.py  \n   ```  \n\n---\n\n### Permanent_Fix  \n1. **Update Dependency Files**:  \n   - Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt`:  \n     ```txt  \n     dexter_brain==<version>  # or path=/path/to/dexter_brain  \n     ```  \n   - If using `setup.py`, include it in `install_requires`:  \n     ```python  \n     setup(  \n         install_requires=['dexter_brain']  \n     )  \n     ```  \n\n2. **Environment Configuration**:  \n   - For Docker:  \n     ```dockerfile  \n     # Install dependencies  \n     COPY requirements.txt .  \n     RUN pip install -r requirements.txt  \n     ```  \n   - For CI/CD: Ensure `pip install -r requirements.txt` runs before startup.  \n\n---\n\n### Prevention  \n1. **Automated Dependency Checks**:  \n   - Add a pre-start script to validate imports:  \n     ```bash  \n     # Example: Check for dexter_brain before starting  \n     python -c \"import dexter_brain\" || { echo \"Missing dexter_brain\"; exit 1; }  \n     ```  \n   - Integrate into CI pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).  \n\n2. **Monitoring**:  \n   - Use tools like Prometheus or Sentry to alert on `ModuleNotFoundError`.  \n   - Log missing module errors with context for faster debugging.  \n\n---\n\n### Risk_Level: MEDIUM  \n- **Immediate Action**: Installing unknown packages could introduce conflicts.  \n- **Permanent Fix**: Low risk if tested in staging first.  \n\n### Confidence: HIGH  \n- The solution addresses common causes of `ModuleNotFoundError` and aligns with Python best practices.  \n\n--- \n\n**Vote**: This approach balances speed (immediate mitigation) and reliability (permanent fixes with monitoring)."
