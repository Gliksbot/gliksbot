  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a ModuleNotFoundError for 'dexter_brain' when starting up their system. The error is a startup error, critical severity. The stack trace points to main.py trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nFirst, root cause. The most likely reason is that the 'dexter_brain' module isn't installed in the current Python environment. Alternatively, the module might be installed but not in the right location, so Python can't find it. Another possibility is a typo in the module name, but the error message says 'No module named 'dexter_brain'', which suggests the name is correct but the module isn't present.\n\nImmediate action: They need to check if the module is installed. They can run 'pip show dexter_brain' to see if it's installed. If not, install it. But if it's a custom module, maybe it's not in the Python path. They should check the project structure. If the module is part of the project, maybe the directory isn't included in the PYTHONPATH. Alternatively, they might need to install the package in development mode if it's a local package.\n\nPermanent fix: If the module is a third-party package, installing it via pip would fix it. If it's a local module, ensuring that the directory containing 'dexter_brain' is in the Python path. Maybe setting up a symlink or adjusting the sys.path in the code. Alternatively, packaging the module properly and installing it as an egg.\n\nPrevention: They should ensure that all dependencies are properly listed in requirements.txt or a similar file. Using virtual environments to manage dependencies. Implementing checks in the CI/CD pipeline to verify that all required modules are present. Also, monitoring for missing modules during startup.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing module is low if it's a known package. However, if 'dexter_brain' is a custom module, there might be compatibility issues if not properly versioned. Adjusting the Python path could lead to issues if not done correctly, but it's manageable.\n\nSo putting it all together. The root cause is the missing module. Immediate action is to install it or adjust the path. Permanent fix involves ensuring the module is available in the environment. Prevention through dependency management and checks.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because the Python interpreter cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to either:  \n1. Missing installation of the required package  \n2. Incorrect Python path configuration preventing module discovery  \n3. Environment-specific dependency issues (e.g., virtualenv vs global install)  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify module installation:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip show dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n2. If missing, install it (if public package):  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter-brain  # Check correct package name  \n   ```  \n3. If custom/internal module:  \n   - Ensure directory containing `dexter_brain/__init__.py` exists  \n   - Add path to `PYTHONPATH`:  \n     ```bash  \n     export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/dexter_brain:$PYTHONPATH  \n     ```  \n4. Verify import works in Python shell:  \n   ```python  \n   python -c \"import dexter_brain\"  \n   ```  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. For third-party packages:  \n   - Add to `requirements.txt`:  \n     ```  \n     dexter-brain==<version>  \n     ```  \n   - Use virtual environments with `pipenv`/`poetry` for isolation  \n2. For internal modules:  \n   - Structure project as package with `setup.py`/`pyproject.toml`  \n   - Install in development mode:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install -e /path/to/dexter_brain  \n     ```  \n3. Ensure consistent environment across deployments (Dockerize if applicable)  \n\nPrevention:  \n- Implement pre-startup health checks for critical imports  \n- Use CI/CD pipeline to validate dependency installation  \n- Monitor `ImportError` occurrences in logging system  \n- Enforce `requirements.txt` version pinning  \n\nRisk_Level: LOW  \nConfidence: HIGH  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
