  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The traceback shows the import happens in main.py line 120. The error type is STARTUP_ERROR, which suggests the system can't start because this module is missing.\n\nLooking at the context, there's no context available, so maybe the environment isn't set up correctly. The system status shows recent and critical errors, so this might be part of a larger issue, but the immediate problem is the missing module.\n\nRoot cause analysis: The most likely causes are that the 'dexter_brain' module isn't installed, not in the Python path, or there's a typo in the import statement. Since the error is during startup, it's probably a missing dependency or incorrect environment setup.\n\nImmediate action would be to check if the module exists in the environment. If it's a package, maybe it needs to be installed via pip. If it's a local module, the directory structure might be wrong, so adding the path could help. Alternatively, a virtual environment might not be activated.\n\nFor a permanent fix, ensuring the module is properly installed or included in the project's dependencies. If it's a third-party package, adding it to requirements.txt. If it's internal, making sure the directory is included in the Python path or using proper relative imports.\n\nPrevention could involve setting up monitoring for missing modules during deployment, using linters or tools like pyflakes to catch import errors before deployment. Also, ensuring that the environment setup steps are correctly documented and automated.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing module is low if it's a known package. However, if 'dexter_brain' is a custom module, there might be versioning issues or dependencies that aren't met. The confidence level here is medium because without more context, we can't be sure if it's a simple install or a more complex setup issue.\n\nSo, the approach would be to first check if the module is installed, then verify the import path. If not, install or adjust the environment accordingly. For implementation, steps like checking the file system, installing packages, modifying sys.path, or adjusting the code.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that Python cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect directory structure or virtual environment misconfiguration).  \n3. **Typo/Mismatch**: A typo in the module name or version mismatch in dependencies.  \n\n**Immediate Action**:  \n1. Verify if `dexter_brain` is a third-party package (e.g., via PyPI) or a local/custom module.  \n2. Check the Python environment (e.g., virtual environment activation, `sys.path` configuration).  \n3. Temporarily add the module’s directory to `sys.path` in `main.py` (if local).  \n\n**Permanent Fix**:  \n1. **If Third-Party**: Install the package via `pip install dexter_brain` (if available).  \n2. **If Local**: Ensure the module’s directory is included in the project’s root or add it to `PYTHONPATH`.  \n3. Update `requirements.txt` or deployment scripts to include the dependency.  \n\n**Prevention**:  \n1. Use dependency management tools (e.g., `pipenv`, `poetry`) to enforce environment consistency.  \n2. Add pre-startup checks (e.g., script to validate module availability).  \n3. Implement static code analysis (e.g., `pyflakes`, `mypy`) to catch import errors early.  \n\n**Risk Assessment**:  \n- **Risk Level**: LOW (installing a missing module is low-risk if the source is trusted).  \n- **Confidence**: MEDIUM (requires confirmation of module origin and environment setup).  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Diagnostic Steps**:  \n   - Check if `dexter_brain` exists in the environment:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip show dexter_brain  # For third-party  \n     ls /path/to/project/dexter_brain  # For local  \n     ```  \n   - Verify Python path:  \n     ```python  \n     import sys  \n     print(sys.path)  \n     ```  \n\n2. **Temporary Fix**:  \n   - Add the module’s directory to `sys.path` in `main.py` (before the import):  \n     ```python  \n     import sys  \n     sys.path.append(\"M:/gliksbot/backend/dexter_brain\")  # Adjust path as needed  \n     ```  \n\n3. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - **Option 1 (Third-Party)**:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install dexter_brain  \n     ```  \n     Add to `requirements.txt`:  \n     ```  \n     dexter_brain==<version>  \n     ```  \n   - **Option 2 (Local Module)**:  \n     - Ensure `dexter_brain` is in the project root or a subdirectory listed in `sys.path`.  \n     - Use relative imports if within the same package.  \n\n4. **Prevention**:  \n   - Add a pre-startup script to validate critical modules:  \n     ```bash  \n     python -c \"import dexter_brain\" || echo \"Missing module: dexter_brain\"  \n     ```  \n   - Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated checks.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n**Skill Spec (If Needed)**:  \nIf `dexter_brain` is a custom module not in the environment:  \n```python  \n# SKILL_SPEC: Module Path Correction  \ndef ensure_module_path():  \n    import sys  \n    import os  \n    project_root = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"..\"))  \n    if project_root not in sys.path:  \n        sys.path.insert(0, project_root)  \n```  \nAdd this function to `main.py` before the problematic import.  \n\n**Code Example**:  \n```python  \n# main.py (updated)  \nimport sys  \nimport os  \n\ndef ensure_module_path():  \n    project_root = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"..\"))  \n    if project_root not in sys.path:  \n        sys.path.insert(0, project_root)  \n\nensure_module_path()  \n\nfrom dexter_brain.sandbox import create_sandbox  \n# ... rest of the code  \n```  \n\n**Deployment Steps**:  \n1. Commit the updated `main.py` and `requirements.txt` (if modified).  \n2. Redeploy the application with the corrected environment.  \n3. Monitor logs for recurrence.  \n\n**Risk Mitigation**:  \n- Test the fix in a staging environment before production.  \n- Use version control to roll back if issues arise.  \n\n--- \n\n**Vote**: This solution balances speed (temporary path fix) and sustainability (permanent environment/dependency fixes) with minimal risk."
