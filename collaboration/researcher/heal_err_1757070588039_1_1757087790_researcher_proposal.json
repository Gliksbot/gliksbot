  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully. The error is a STARTUP_ERROR with the message \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". The stack trace shows that the main.py file is trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox, but it's not found.\n\nFirst, the root cause. The error is a ModuleNotFoundError, which usually means that the required Python module isn't installed or isn't in the right directory. Since the error occurs during startup, it's possible that the dexter_brain module isn't installed in the current environment. Alternatively, the Python path might not include the directory where dexter_brain is located. Another possibility is that the module was installed but under a different name or in a virtual environment that's not activated.\n\nLooking at the system status, there are recent errors and critical errors, but the context isn't available. The source is the system itself, so maybe the startup script is missing dependencies. The error is critical, so it's preventing the system from starting up properly.\n\nImmediate actions would involve checking if the module exists, verifying the installation, and ensuring the environment is correct. The user might need to install the module using pip, or if it's a local module, ensure it's in the right place. Also, checking the Python path to see if it includes the directory where dexter_brain is located.\n\nFor a permanent fix, the solution would involve installing the missing module, either via pip if it's a third-party package, or by adding the correct path if it's a local module. If it's a custom module, the team might need to ensure that the repository is properly cloned and included in the project structure. Also, setting up a virtual environment and ensuring that all dependencies are listed in a requirements.txt file would help prevent this in the future.\n\nPrevention could involve adding checks during the startup process to verify that all required modules are present. Implementing dependency management with tools like pipenv or poetry could help. Also, monitoring for missing modules and setting up alerts would be useful. Maybe adding a pre-start script that checks for required modules and installs them if missing.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing module could be medium if the module isn't well-maintained or if it introduces conflicts. However, since the system is already expecting this module, it's likely a necessary dependency. The risk of modifying the Python path could be low if done correctly, but there's a chance of pointing to the wrong directory.\n\nNow, considering the response format, I need to structure it into Analysis, Immediate Action, Permanent Fix, Prevention, Risk Level, and Confidence. Also, the user mentioned a collaboration session, so maybe the solution should be presented in a way that others can follow.\n\nWait, the user also mentioned that if a new skill is required, provide a SKILL_SPEC and code. But in this case, the solution seems to be standard Python troubleshooting, so maybe no new skill is needed. However, if the system requires specific deployment steps, perhaps a script to check dependencies could be a new skill. But the user might not need that here.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAnalysis: The error is due to the absence of the 'dexter_brain' module in the Python environment. Possible reasons include missing installation, incorrect Python path, or environment misconfiguration.\n\nImmediate Action: Check if the module exists locally, install it via pip if it's a package, or add the directory to PYTHONPATH. If it's a local module, ensure it's in the correct location and the environment is set up properly.\n\nPermanent Fix: Install the required module, update dependencies, and ensure the environment is correctly configured. Use a virtual environment and pin dependencies.\n\nPrevention: Implement dependency checks, use virtual environments, and monitor for missing modules.\n\nRisk Level: Medium, because installing a new module could have dependencies that conflict, but necessary for system operation.\n\nConfidence: High, since the error is straightforward and common.\n\nI need to make sure the steps are concrete. For example, specific commands to install the module, check the path, etc. Also, considering that the system might be in a production environment, so the immediate action should be safe and not disrupt other services.\n\nAnother thing: The error is on Windows (M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\main.py), so the commands might differ slightly from Unix-like systems. For example, using the Windows path for PYTHONPATH.\n\nSo, the immediate action steps could be:\n\n1. Check if 'dexter_brain' is installed by running 'pip show dexter_brain' or 'python -c \"import dexter_brain\"'. If not installed, proceed to install.\n\n2. If it's a third-party package, install via pip: 'pip install dexter-brain' (if the package name is different, maybe with hyphens or underscores).\n\n3. If it's a local module, ensure that the directory containing 'dexter_brain' is in the Python path. For example, add the parent directory of 'dexter_brain' to PYTHONPATH environment variable.\n\n4. Alternatively, run the script from the directory where 'dexter_brain' is located, or adjust the sys.path in main.py to include the correct path.\n\nFor permanent fix, setting up a virtual environment and requirements.txt would help. Also, ensuring that the deployment process includes installing all dependencies.\n\nPrevention could involve adding a check in the startup script to verify the presence of required modules and log warnings or errors if missing. Also, using continuous integration to test the environment setup.\n\nRisk assessment: Installing a new module could introduce new dependencies or conflicts, but if it's a known required module, the risk is medium. The confidence is high because this is a standard issue.\n\nI think that covers all the points. Now, structure it into the required sections.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to one of the following:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in a directory included in the `PYTHONPATH` or Python's module search path.  \n3. **Environment Misconfiguration**: The system is using an incorrect Python environment (e.g., global instead of virtual).  \n\nThe error occurs at startup, preventing the system from initializing. Given the context (Windows path `M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\main.py`), the issue is likely environment-specific.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Immediate Action**: Verify module availability and environment configuration.  \n2. **Permanent Fix**: Install the module or adjust paths, and enforce dependency management.  \n3. **Prevention**: Implement dependency checks and environment standardization.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### **Immediate_Action**  \n1. **Check Module Installation**:  \n   Run in the command prompt (ensure the correct Python environment is active):  \n   ```bash  \n   pip show dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If not found, proceed to install.  \n\n2. **Install the Module**:  \n   If `dexter_brain` is a third-party package:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter-brain  # Check package name on PyPI if uncertain  \n   ```  \n   If itâ€™s a local/custom module:  \n   - Ensure the directory containing `dexter_brain` is in the project root (e.g., `M:\\gliksbot\\`).  \n   - Add the directory to `PYTHONPATH`:  \n     ```bash  \n     set PYTHONPATH=M:\\gliksbot;%PYTHONPATH%  \n     ```  \n\n3. **Test Import**:  \n   Run Python interactively to verify:  \n   ```python  \n   import dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n\n---\n\n#### **Permanent_Fix**  \n1. **Environment Standardization**:  \n   - Use a virtual environment (e.g., `venv`) and activate it:  \n     ```bash  \n     python -m venv venv  \n     venv\\Scripts\\activate  \n     ```  \n   - Install dependencies explicitly:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install -r requirements.txt  \n     ```  \n\n2. **Pin Dependencies**:  \n   Create/update `requirements.txt` to include `dexter_brain` (or its source if private):  \n   ```txt  \n   dexter-brain==x.x.x  \n   ```  \n\n3. **Adjust Module Path (if local)**:  \n   Modify `main.py` to add the module directory to `sys.path` (temporary workaround):  \n   ```python  \n   import sys  \n   sys.path.append(\"M:\\\\gliksbot\")  # Use absolute path  \n   ```  \n\n---\n\n#### **Prevention**  \n1. **Dependency Check in Startup Script**:  \n   Add a pre-check in `main.py` to validate required modules:  \n   ```python  \n   try:  \n       import dexter_brain  \n   except ImportError:  \n       raise RuntimeError(\"Missing dependency: dexter_brain. Install it via 'pip install dexter-brain'\")  \n   ```  \n\n2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:  \n   Integrate a script to test module availability during deployment.  \n\n3. **Monitoring**:  \n   Set up alerts for `ModuleNotFoundError` in logs.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Risk_Level**  \n**MEDIUM**  \n- **Risk**: Installing a new module could introduce conflicts with existing dependencies.  \n- **Mitigation**: Test in a staging environment before deploying to production.  \n\n#### **Confidence**  \n**HIGH**  \nThis is a common Python error with well-established solutions.  \n\n--- \n\n### SKILL_SPEC (Optional)  \nIf automation is required for dependency checks, create a `dependency_checker.py` script:  \n```python  \n# dependency_checker.py  \nimport importlib.util  \nrequired_modules = [\"dexter_brain\"]  \n\nfor module in required_modules:  \n    if not importlib.util.find_spec(module):  \n        raise ImportError(f\"Missing required module: {module}\")  \n```  \nRun this before startup:  \n```bash  \npython dependency_checker.py  \n```"
