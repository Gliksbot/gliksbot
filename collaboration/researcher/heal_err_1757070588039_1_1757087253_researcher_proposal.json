  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The traceback shows it's happening in main.py line 120 during the startup_event. The module dexter_brain is supposed to be there, but it's missing.\n\nLooking at the context, there's no context available, which might mean the system didn't log any additional info. The system status shows recent and critical errors, but the main issue here is the missing module.\n\nRoot cause analysis: The most likely reasons are that the dexter_brain module isn't installed, not in the Python path, or there's a typo in the import statement. Since the error is a ModuleNotFoundError, it's probably not installed or not in the right directory.\n\nImmediate action: The user needs to check if the module exists. They should look in the project directory to see if dexter_brain is present. If it's a third-party package, maybe it wasn't installed. If it's a local module, maybe the directory structure changed. They could try installing it via pip if it's a package, or adjust the sys.path to include the correct directory.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure the module is properly installed or linked. If it's a local module, maybe create a symbolic link or adjust the project structure. If it's a package, add it to the requirements.txt and install it. Also, check the import statements for any typos.\n\nPrevention: Implement checks during deployment to verify all required modules are present. Use virtual environments to manage dependencies. Set up monitoring to alert if modules are missing. Maybe add a pre-startup script that checks for necessary modules.\n\nRisk assessment: The immediate action of installing a package might introduce new dependencies or conflicts, so that's a medium risk. Adjusting sys.path could have side effects if not done carefully, so also medium. The permanent fix of adjusting the project structure or dependencies is lower risk once verified.\n\nI should structure the response with Analysis, Immediate Action, Permanent Fix, Prevention, and Risk Level. Also, check if any new skills are needed. Since this is a standard Python error, probably no new skills required. Just provide the steps clearly.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to one of the following:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Path Issue**: The module exists but is not in the Python path.  \n3. **Typo/Case Sensitivity**: A typo in the module name or case mismatch (e.g., `Dexter_Brain` vs. `dexter_brain`).  \n4. **Project Structure**: The module is in a subdirectory not recognized by the interpreter.  \n\nThe error occurs during the `startup_event` in `main.py`, suggesting the system relies on `dexter_brain` for core functionality.  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Immediate Action**:  \n   - Verify the existence and location of the `dexter_brain` module.  \n   - Check for typos in the import statement.  \n   - Ensure the module is installed or accessible in the current environment.  \n\n2. **Permanent Fix**:  \n   - Install the module (if missing) or adjust the project structure to include it in the Python path.  \n   - Use virtual environments to manage dependencies.  \n\n3. **Prevention**:  \n   - Implement dependency checks during deployment.  \n   - Use `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile` to standardize dependencies.  \n   - Add pre-startup validation scripts.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n\n#### **Immediate_Action**  \n1. **Check Module Existence**:  \n   - Run `dir(M:\\gliksbot\\backend)` to confirm if `dexter_brain` exists in the project directory.  \n   - If missing, restore from backups or version control.  \n\n2. **Verify Python Path**:  \n   - Add the project root to `sys.path` in `main.py` (temporarily):  \n     ```python  \n     import sys  \n     sys.path.append(\"M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\backend\")  \n     ```  \n\n3. **Install Dependencies**:  \n   - If `dexter_brain` is a third-party package, install it:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install dexter_brain  \n     ```  \n   - If it’s a local module, ensure it’s included in the repository.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Permanent_Fix**  \n1. **Project Structure**:  \n   - Ensure `dexter_brain` is in a directory listed in `sys.path`.  \n   - Example: Move `dexter_brain` to `M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\` or create a symbolic link.  \n\n2. **Dependency Management**:  \n   - Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt`:  \n     ```txt  \n     dexter_brain==<version>  \n     ```  \n   - Use a virtual environment:  \n     ```bash  \n     python -m venv venv  \n     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate  \n     pip install -r requirements.txt  \n     ```  \n\n3. **Code Adjustments**:  \n   - Use relative imports if `dexter_brain` is part of the same package:  \n     ```python  \n     from . import dexter_brain  # If in the same directory as main.py  \n     ```  \n\n---\n\n#### **Prevention**  \n1. **Pre-Startup Validation**:  \n   - Add a script to check for required modules before launching:  \n     ```python  \n     # validate_modules.py  \n     try:  \n         import dexter_brain  \n     except ImportError:  \n         raise RuntimeError(\"Missing module: dexter_brain\")  \n     ```  \n\n2. **Monitoring**:  \n   - Set up alerts for `ModuleNotFoundError` in logs.  \n   - Use tools like `Sentry` or `Datadog` for error tracking.  \n\n3. **CI/CD Integration**:  \n   - Add a test step in CI/CD pipelines to validate dependencies:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip freeze | grep dexter_brain || exit 1  \n     ```  \n\n---\n\n#### **Risk_Level**  \n- **Immediate Action**: MEDIUM (Temporary path modifications may cause side effects.)  \n- **Permanent Fix**: LOW (Proper dependency management is standard practice.)  \n\n#### **Confidence**  \n- HIGH (The error is a common Python issue with well-documented solutions.)  \n\n--- \n\n### SKILL_SPEC (If Required)  \nNo new skills are needed. This requires standard Python troubleshooting and dependency management.  \n\n--- \n\n**Vote**: This solution balances rapid mitigation (immediate actions) with long-term stability (dependency management and monitoring)."
