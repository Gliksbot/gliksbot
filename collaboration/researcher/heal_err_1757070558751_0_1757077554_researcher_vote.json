  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user is getting a ModuleNotFoundError for 'dexter_brain' when starting up the system. The error is a startup error, critical severity, and it's happened twice. The stack trace points to line 120 in main.py trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nFirst, root cause. The most likely reason is that the 'dexter_brain' module isn't installed in the Python environment where the script is running. Alternatively, the module might be installed but not in the right location, so Python can't find it. Maybe the environment isn't activated, or there's a virtual environment issue. Another possibility is that the module is part of the project but not properly structured or included in the Python path.\n\nImmediate action: The user needs to check if the module exists. They can try installing it if it's a third-party package. If it's a local module, they should ensure it's in the correct directory and that the Python path includes that directory. Maybe running pip install dexter_brain if it's available on PyPI. If not, they might need to create a symlink or adjust the sys.path in the code to include the module's location.\n\nPermanent fix: If the module is part of the project, they should structure it so that it's included in the package. Maybe adding it to the setup.py or pyproject.toml so that when the project is installed, the module is available. Alternatively, if it's a third-party module, ensuring it's included in the dependencies and installed correctly in the environment. Also, checking the import statements to make sure they're correct.\n\nPrevention: Setting up proper dependency management, using virtual environments, and ensuring that all required modules are listed in requirements.txt or similar. Implementing automated tests that check for missing modules during CI/CD pipelines. Monitoring for import errors during startup and logging them appropriately.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a third-party module could be medium if it's not well-maintained. Adjusting the Python path might have low risk if done correctly but could lead to issues if the path is hardcoded. The confidence in the solution depends on whether the module is indeed missing or if there's a path issue. If the user can confirm the module's presence, then adjusting the path is safe. Otherwise, installing the module is the way to go.\n\nSo, putting this all together. The analysis would point to the missing module. Immediate action is to install it or adjust the path. Permanent fix involves ensuring dependencies are managed. Prevention through better dependency tracking. Risks are low to medium depending on the solution.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because Python cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. The module is not installed in the current Python environment  \n2. The module is installed but not in a directory included in Python's search path  \n3. The module is part of the project but improperly structured or not included in the package  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' is a third-party package:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If not found, check if it's a local module:  \n2. Confirm the module exists in the project directory structure  \n3. If local module exists but not recognized, temporarily add its path:  \n   ```python  \n   # In main.py before import  \n   import sys  \n   sys.path.append(\"M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\path_to_dexter_brain\")  \n   ```  \n4. Retry startup  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. If third-party package:  \n   - Add to requirements.txt  \n   - Ensure environment uses virtualenv with proper dependencies  \n2. If local module:  \n   - Structure as Python package (add __init__.py in dexter_brain directory)  \n   - Install project in development mode:  \n     ```bash  \n     pip install -e .  \n     ```  \n   - Or add to sys.path in startup script permanently  \n\nPrevention:  \n- Implement dependency checks in CI/CD pipeline  \n- Use pyproject.toml for explicit dependencies  \n- Add pre-startup script to validate module availability  \n- Monitor Python path configuration in production  \n\nRisk_Level: LOW  \nConfidence: HIGH  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
