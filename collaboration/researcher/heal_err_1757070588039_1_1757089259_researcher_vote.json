  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The stack trace points to line 120 in main.py where it's trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox. So the immediate issue is a missing module.\n\nLooking at the system status, there are recent errors and critical ones. The error type is STARTUP_ERROR, which suggests the system can't start up properly because of this missing module. The source is 'system', so it's a core part of the application.\n\nRoot cause: The module 'dexter_brain' isn't installed or not in the Python path. Maybe it's a custom module that wasn't included in the environment, or there's a typo in the name. Alternatively, the package might not be installed correctly, or the virtual environment isn't activated.\n\nImmediate action: Check if the module exists in the project directory. If it's a local module, ensure it's in the right location and that the Python path includes it. If it's a third-party package, install it using pip. Also, check the environment variables and the PYTHONPATH to see if the directory containing 'dexter_brain' is included.\n\nPermanent fix: If it's a third-party package, add it to the requirements.txt and ensure it's installed in the environment. If it's a local module, structure the project so that the module is in a directory that's part of the Python path. Maybe adjust the import statements or use relative imports if necessary. Also, check for any typos in the module name.\n\nPrevention: Implement checks during deployment to ensure all required modules are installed. Use virtual environments to manage dependencies. Monitor for missing modules during startup and set up alerts. Maybe include a step in the CI/CD pipeline to verify dependencies.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing module could be low if it's a known package. However, if 'dexter_brain' is a custom module, there might be issues with compatibility or missing files. The risk level here is probably medium because the system can't start without it, but the fix is straightforward if the module is available.\n\nConfidence: High, because the error is a common Python issue with a clear solution path. The main variables are whether the module exists and is accessible.\n\nSo putting it all together, the analysis would focus on the missing module. Immediate action would involve checking the environment and installing or linking the module. Permanent fix would involve ensuring the module is properly included in the project structure and dependencies. Prevention would include dependency checks and environment management. Risk is medium, confidence high.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because Python cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. The module is not installed in the current Python environment  \n2. The module exists but is not in the Python path  \n3. There is a typo/mismatch in the module name  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' is a local module or third-party package  \n2. If local: Check if the module file/directory exists in M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\ or parent directories  \n3. If third-party: Run `pip install dexter_brain` in the environment  \n4. Check PYTHONPATH environment variable to ensure it includes the module's location  \n5. Verify virtual environment activation (if applicable)  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. If local module:  \n   - Ensure 'dexter_brain' directory is at the same level as main.py  \n   - Add `import sys; sys.path.append('M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\backend')` to main.py if needed  \n2. If third-party package:  \n   - Add 'dexter_brain' to requirements.txt  \n   - Implement dependency installation in deployment pipeline  \n3. Use relative imports if module is part of the same package  \n\nPrevention:  \n- Add pre-startup check script to validate all required modules  \n- Implement dependency validation in CI/CD pipeline  \n- Use pyproject.toml or setup.py for package management  \n- Monitor Python path configuration in production environments  \n\nRisk_Level: MEDIUM (Fix requires environment changes that could affect other components if not tested)  \nConfidence: HIGH (Common Python import error with well-established solutions)  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
