  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The traceback points to line 120 in main.py where it's trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox.\n\nLooking at the error type, it's a STARTUP_ERROR, which suggests the system can't start because of this missing module. The severity is critical, so it's a big issue.\n\nRoot cause analysis: The most likely reason is that the 'dexter_brain' module isn't installed or isn't in the Python path. Maybe it's a custom module that wasn't included in the deployment, or the virtual environment isn't activated. Alternatively, there could be a typo in the import statement, but the error message doesn't indicate that. Since the error occurs during startup, it's probably a missing dependency.\n\nImmediate action: The user needs to check if the module exists. They should look in the project directory for a folder named 'dexter_brain' or check if it's a package that needs to be installed. If it's a local module, ensuring it's in the right location and that the Python path includes it. If it's a third-party package, installing it via pip. Also, checking the virtual environment to make sure it's active and has all dependencies.\n\nPermanent fix: If the module is part of the project, adding it to the Python path in the code or configuring the environment correctly. If it's a third-party package, adding it to the requirements.txt and ensuring it's installed during deployment. Also, checking the import statement for any typos. Maybe setting up a proper setup.py or pyproject.toml to package the module correctly.\n\nPrevention: Implementing checks during deployment to ensure all dependencies are installed. Using virtual environments and requirements files to track dependencies. Adding automated tests that check for missing modules. Monitoring for import errors during startup and alerting before they cause issues.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing module could be medium if the module has dependencies that might conflict with existing ones. If the module is not properly maintained, there might be security risks. However, since it's a startup error, fixing it is critical, so the risk is justified.\n\nConfidence: High, because the error is straightforward. The solution involves checking and installing the missing module, which is a common issue.\n\nWait, but what if 'dexter_brain' is a custom module that's supposed to be in the same directory? Then the problem might be that the current working directory isn't set correctly, or the module isn't in the right place. The user should check the file structure. Alternatively, if it's a package installed via pip, maybe the package name is different from the import name. For example, sometimes packages have different names on PyPI. So the user should verify the correct package name and install that.\n\nAnother angle: The error occurs on startup, so maybe during deployment, the module wasn't included in the build. If using something like PyInstaller or a Docker container, the build process might not have included the module. So checking the build configuration to ensure all necessary files are included.\n\nIn terms of immediate action, steps could be:\n\n1. Check if 'dexter_brain' is present in the project directory.\n2. If it's a local module, ensure it's in the Python path by adding the directory to sys.path or setting PYTHONPATH.\n3. If it's a package, install it using pip install dexter_brain (if that's the correct package name).\n4. Check the requirements.txt to see if it's listed and run pip install -r requirements.txt.\n5. Verify the virtual environment is activated and that the correct Python interpreter is being used.\n\nFor permanent fix, ensuring that the deployment process includes all necessary modules, either by proper packaging or dependency management. If it's a custom module, structuring the project so that it's included in the source distribution.\n\nPrevention could involve using tools like pip-tools to manage dependencies, or CI/CD pipelines that test the installation process. Also, adding a check in the startup script to verify that all required modules are present before proceeding.\n\nRisk level: Medium, because installing a new package might introduce conflicts, but since the system isn't starting without it, the risk is acceptable. Confidence is high because this is a common issue with a standard solution.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because Python cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. The module is missing from the environment (not installed or not included in deployment).  \n2. The module exists but is not in the Python path.  \n3. A typo or case sensitivity issue in the import statement (unlikely here, as the error message matches the import exactly).  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. **Verify module existence**: Check if a local `dexter_brain` directory exists in the project root or if it’s a third-party package.  \n2. **Install dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if a requirements file exists) or `pip install dexter_brain` (if it’s a PyPI package).  \n3. **Check Python path**: Ensure the module’s parent directory is in `sys.path`. Temporarily add it in `main.py` before the import:  \n   ```python  \n   import sys  \n   sys.path.append(\"M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\\")  # Adjust path as needed  \n   ```  \n4. **Validate environment**: Confirm the correct virtual environment is activated and matches the deployment setup.  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. **Package management**:  \n   - If `dexter_brain` is a local module, ensure it’s included in the project’s source distribution (e.g., via `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`).  \n   - If it’s a third-party package, add it to `requirements.txt` and ensure it’s installed during deployment.  \n2. **Environment configuration**: Use tools like `pipenv`, `poetry`, or Docker to enforce dependency isolation and path consistency.  \n3. **Code adjustment**: If the module is internal, restructure the project to avoid manual path additions (e.g., install the project in development mode: `pip install -e .`).  \n\nPrevention:  \n1. **Automated dependency checks**: Add a pre-startup script to validate required modules are importable.  \n2. **CI/CD integration**: Include tests that verify module availability in the build pipeline.  \n3. **Monitoring**: Implement logging for missing modules during startup and alert on failures.  \n\nRisk_Level: MEDIUM  \n- **Risk**: Installing a missing module could introduce conflicts if dependencies are outdated or incompatible.  \n- **Mitigation**: Test the fix in a staging environment before deploying to production.  \n\nConfidence: HIGH  \nThe solution addresses the most common causes of `ModuleNotFoundError` and aligns with standard Python troubleshooting practices.  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
