  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That usually means Python can't find the module when trying to import it. The stack trace points to line 120 in main.py where it's trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox. So the immediate issue is that the module isn't available in the environment where the code is running.\n\nLooking at the system status, there are recent errors and critical ones, but the main focus here is the startup error. The mission is to diagnose and provide solutions. Let's break down the analysis required.\n\nRoot Cause: The most likely reason is that the 'dexter_brain' package isn't installed in the Python environment. Alternatively, it might be installed but not in the right location, or there's a virtual environment issue where the environment isn't activated. Another possibility is a typo in the module name, but the error message seems to indicate the exact name, so maybe not. Also, if the module is a local package, maybe it's not properly structured with an __init__.py file, or the Python path isn't set correctly.\n\nImmediate Action: The user needs to check if the module is installed. They can run pip install dexter_brain if it's a third-party package. If it's a local module, they should ensure it's in the same directory or a directory included in the PYTHONPATH. Alternatively, if the project uses a virtual environment, they should activate it. They might also check the file structure to confirm the module exists where expected.\n\nPermanent Fix: If the module is part of the project, it should be included in the project's dependencies. Adding it to the requirements.txt or pyproject.toml so that it's installed automatically when setting up the environment. If it's a local module, ensuring the directory structure is correct and that the module is properly imported. Also, checking the code for any dynamic imports that might be failing.\n\nPrevention: Implementing checks during deployment to ensure all dependencies are installed. Using virtual environments to isolate project dependencies. Adding automated tests that check for module availability. Monitoring for missing modules during startup and alerting before it becomes a critical issue.\n\nRisk Assessment: The risk of installing a new package could be medium if it's not well-maintained, but if it's a known dependency, then low. If the module is local, the risk is lower. The main risk is ensuring that the correct version is installed and that it doesn't conflict with other packages.\n\nNow, putting this into the required format. The root cause is the missing module. Immediate action would be installing the package or checking the environment. Permanent fix is adding it to dependencies. Prevention through dependency management and monitoring. Risk level would be low to medium depending on the solution.\n\nI should also consider that the user might not have the module installed at all. If 'dexter_brain' is a third-party package, installing it via pip would fix it. If it's a custom module, then the project structure might be incorrect. The error occurs during startup, so the system can't proceed without it. The solution needs to address both possibilities.\n\nAnother angle: the error could be due to a misconfigured Python path. The script might be running from a different directory, so the relative imports are failing. Checking the working directory and sys.path settings could help. Adding the project root to PYTHONPATH might resolve it.\n\nIn the immediate action, steps like checking installation, verifying environment, checking file structure, and adjusting paths would be necessary. For permanent fix, ensuring that the setup process includes all necessary dependencies and paths.\n\nPrevention could involve using tools like pipenv or poetry to manage dependencies, ensuring that the environment is consistent across deployments. Also, including a check in the startup script to verify that all required modules are present before proceeding.\n\nRisk of implementing the solution: If installing a package, there's a risk of version incompatibility, but if it's the correct package, then low risk. If modifying the Python path, there's a risk of affecting other scripts, so medium risk.\n\nConfidence in the solution would be high if the module is indeed missing, which seems to be the case here. The error message is straightforward, so the solution should be correct.\n</think>\n\nAnalysis: The error occurs because the Python interpreter cannot locate the 'dexter_brain' module during startup. This is likely due to one of three reasons:  \n1. The module is not installed in the active Python environment  \n2. The module is installed but not in a directory included in the Python path  \n3. The module exists but has an incorrect structure (missing __init__.py)  \n\nImmediate_Action:  \n1. Verify if 'dexter_brain' is a third-party package:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If not found, check if it's a local module.  \n2. If local:  \n   - Confirm the module exists in the project directory  \n   - Ensure the file structure includes `dexter_brain/__init__.py`  \n   - Add the project root to PYTHONPATH:  \n     ```bash  \n     export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/gliksbot/backend:$PYTHONPATH  \n     ```  \n3. If using virtual environments:  \n   - Activate the environment:  \n     ```bash  \n     source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac  \n     venv\\Scripts\\activate     # Windows  \n     ```  \n\nPermanent_Fix:  \n1. Add 'dexter_brain' to project dependencies:  \n   - If third-party: Add to `requirements.txt`  \n   - If local: Ensure it's included in the project package structure with proper `__init__.py` files  \n2. Modify `main.py` to include explicit path handling if needed:  \n   ```python  \n   import sys  \n   sys.path.append(\"/path/to/gliksbot/backend\")  \n   ```  \n3. Implement dependency verification in startup script:  \n   ```python  \n   try:  \n       import dexter_brain  \n   except ImportError:  \n       print(\"Critical: dexter_brain module missing\")  \n       # Trigger alert or auto-install logic  \n   ```  \n\nPrevention:  \n- Use dependency management tools (pipenv, poetry)  \n- Add pre-startup checks for required modules  \n- Implement monitoring for Python path integrity  \n- Use CI/CD pipeline checks for module availability  \n\nRisk_Level: LOW  \nConfidence: HIGH  \n\nVOTE: <llm_name>"
