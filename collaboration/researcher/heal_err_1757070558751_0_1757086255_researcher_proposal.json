  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this system error. The user provided a detailed error report, so I need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the error message is \"No module named 'dexter_brain'\". That's a Python error, right? When Python can't find a module, it's usually because the module isn't installed, or it's not in the right directory. The traceback shows that the error occurs in main.py when trying to import from dexter_brain.sandbox. So the system is trying to start up but can't find this module.\n\nLooking at the context, there's no context available, which might mean the error happens early in the startup process. The system status mentions 29 recent errors and 2 critical ones, with 2 related startup errors. That suggests this might be a recurring issue, maybe after some changes or deployments.\n\nThe mission is to diagnose and provide healing solutions. The analysis needs root cause, immediate action, permanent fix, prevention, and risk assessment.\n\nRoot cause: The most likely cause is that the 'dexter_brain' module isn't installed in the Python environment where the backend is running. Alternatively, it could be installed but not in the correct Python path. Another possibility is a typo in the module name, but the error message seems to indicate the exact name. Since the error is during startup, maybe the module wasn't included in the deployment package or the virtual environment wasn't activated.\n\nImmediate action: The user needs to check if the module is installed. They can run pip list or pip show dexter_brain to verify. If it's not there, installing it would be the first step. If it's a local module, maybe the directory structure is incorrect, and they need to adjust the PYTHONPATH or move the module to the right location. Alternatively, if the module is part of the project, maybe the setup.py or requirements.txt is missing it, so they should check those files.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure that the module is included in the project's dependencies. If it's a third-party package, add it to requirements.txt. If it's an internal package, make sure it's properly packaged and installed. Also, check the deployment process to confirm that all dependencies are installed correctly in the production environment. Maybe setting up a virtual environment and using a requirements file would help.\n\nPrevention: Implement automated checks in the CI/CD pipeline to verify that all required modules are present before deployment. Also, monitoring the system for missing modules during startup and setting up alerts. Maybe using tools like pytest to run tests that import all necessary modules to catch such issues early.\n\nRisk assessment: The risk of installing a missing module is low if it's a known dependency. However, if the module has dependencies of its own, there could be compatibility issues. Also, changing the PYTHONPATH might affect other parts of the system if not done carefully. The confidence level here is high because the error is straightforward, but it depends on whether the module is indeed missing or if there's a more complex issue.\n\nWait, but the error is in the backend's main.py. So the 'dexter_brain' module should be part of the project's codebase. If it's a local module, maybe the file structure is incorrect. For example, if the dexter_brain directory isn't in the same directory as main.py, or if there's no __init__.py file in the dexter_brain directory, making it not a package. So checking the file structure and ensuring that the module is in the right place relative to where main.py is running.\n\nAnother angle: The system might be using a virtual environment, and the module is installed globally but not in the virtual env. Or vice versa. So activating the correct environment and installing the module there.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRoot cause: Missing 'dexter_brain' module in the Python environment or incorrect file structure.\n\nImmediate action: Check if the module exists in the project directory, verify installation, install if missing, adjust PYTHONPATH if necessary.\n\nPermanent fix: Ensure the module is part of the project's dependencies, included in version control, and properly installed during deployment.\n\nPrevention: Add checks in CI/CD, monitor for similar errors, document dependencies.\n\nRisks: Low to medium, depending on the environment. Confidence high if the module is simply missing.\n\nNow, the user wants the response in a specific format with Analysis, Approach, Implementation. Also, if a new skill is needed, provide SKILL_SPEC and code. But in this case, the solution seems to be standard Python troubleshooting, so maybe no new skill is required. However, if the system needs to automatically check for missing modules, that might require a script or a monitoring tool. But the user might just need the steps to fix it manually.\n\nSo the initial proposal should outline the analysis, then the approach to fix, and the implementation steps.\n</think>\n\n### Analysis  \n**Root Cause**:  \nThe error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dexter_brain'` indicates that the Python interpreter cannot locate the `dexter_brain` module during startup. This is likely due to:  \n1. **Missing Installation**: The module is not installed in the current Python environment.  \n2. **Incorrect Path**: The module exists but is not in the Python path (e.g., incorrect directory structure or missing `__init__.py`).  \n3. **Deployment Issue**: The module was not included in the deployment package or virtual environment.  \n\n**Immediate Action**:  \n1. Verify if `dexter_brain` is installed (`pip list | grep dexter_brain` or `pip show dexter_brain`).  \n2. Check the file structure to ensure `dexter_brain` is in the correct directory (e.g., same level as `main.py` or a subdirectory with `__init__.py`).  \n3. If missing, install the module or restore it from version control.  \n\n**Permanent Fix**:  \n1. **Dependency Management**: Add `dexter_brain` to `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` to ensure it is installed during deployment.  \n2. **Directory Structure**: Confirm `dexter_brain` is part of the project repository and placed in a location accessible to Python (e.g., `sys.path.append()` if necessary).  \n3. **Environment Consistency**: Use a virtual environment with pinned dependencies to avoid version mismatches.  \n\n**Prevention**:  \n1. **CI/CD Checks**: Add a pre-deployment script to validate all required modules are present and importable.  \n2. **Monitoring**: Implement logging/alerting for `ModuleNotFoundError` during startup.  \n3. **Documentation**: Clearly document dependencies and directory structure for future deployments.  \n\n**Risk Assessment**:  \n- **Risk Level**: LOW (installing a missing module is low-risk if dependencies are verified).  \n- **Confidence**: HIGH (the error is straightforward and common in Python environments).  \n\n---\n\n### Approach  \n1. **Diagnosis**: Confirm whether `dexter_brain` is a third-party package or a local module.  \n2. **Quick Fix**: Install the module or adjust the Python path temporarily.  \n3. **Long-Term Solution**: Integrate the module into the projectâ€™s dependency management and deployment pipeline.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation  \n**Immediate Action Steps**:  \n1. **Check Installation**:  \n   ```bash  \n   # For global or virtual environment  \n   pip list | grep dexter_brain  \n   ```  \n   If not found, install it:  \n   ```bash  \n   pip install dexter_brain  # If third-party  \n   ```  \n\n2. **Verify File Structure**:  \n   Ensure `dexter_brain` is in the project directory (e.g., `M:\\gliksbot\\backend\\dexter_brain\\`) with an `__init__.py` file.  \n\n3. **Adjust Python Path (if needed)**:  \n   Temporarily add the directory to `sys.path` in `main.py` (not recommended for production):  \n   ```python  \n   import sys  \n   sys.path.append(\"M:\\\\gliksbot\\\\backend\")  \n   ```  \n\n**Permanent Fix**:  \n1. **Update `requirements.txt`**:  \n   Add `dexter_brain` (if third-party) or include the local module in the repository.  \n2. **Deploy with Virtual Environment**:  \n   Use a `requirements.txt` file and create a virtual environment:  \n   ```bash  \n   python -m venv venv  \n   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS  \n   venv\\Scripts\\activate     # Windows  \n   pip install -r requirements.txt  \n   ```  \n\n**Prevention Script (CI/CD Check)**:  \nAdd a pre-deployment script (`check_modules.py`):  \n```python  \n# check_modules.py  \nimport importlib.util  \n\nrequired_modules = [\"dexter_brain\"]  \n\nfor module in required_modules:  \n    if not importlib.util.find_spec(module):  \n        raise ImportError(f\"Missing required module: {module}\")  \n```  \nRun this in CI/CD pipelines:  \n```bash  \npython check_modules.py  \n```  \n\n**Risk Mitigation**:  \n- Test the fix in a staging environment before deploying to production.  \n- Use version control to track changes to dependencies and directory structure.  \n\n--- \n\n**SKILL_SPEC (Optional)**:  \nIf automated module validation is required, create a custom skill to scan dependencies:  \n```python  \n# module_validator.py  \nimport os  \nimport importlib.util  \n\ndef validate_module(module_name, paths):  \n    for path in paths:  \n        full_path = os.path.join(path, module_name)  \n        if os.path.exists(full_path) and os.path.isdir(full_path):  \n            return True  \n    spec = importlib.util.find_spec(module_name)  \n    return spec is not None  \n\n# Example usage  \npaths = [\"/path/to/project\", \"/another/path\"]  \nif not validate_module(\"dexter_brain\", paths):  \n    print(\"ERROR: dexter_brain not found in expected paths.\")  \n```"
