### Analysis
The user is seeking a personalized question that only they would know the answer to. This implies a need for a question that is specific to their personal experiences, preferences, or knowledge. The challenge lies in formulating a question that is both meaningful and unique to the individual, ensuring that it cannot be easily guessed or answered by others.

### Approach
1. **Identify Personal Context**: Gather information about the user’s interests, experiences, and significant life events. This can include hobbies, favorite places, memorable events, or unique experiences.
2. **Formulate Questions**: Based on the identified context, create a set of questions that require specific knowledge or experiences that are unlikely to be known by others.
3. **Iterate for Uniqueness**: Ensure that the questions are not only personal but also varied enough to provide options for the user to choose from.

### Implementation
To implement this approach, we can create a simple framework that prompts the user for information about their personal experiences and then generates a tailored question. Here’s a SKILL_SPEC that outlines the necessary skill and a code snippet to facilitate this process.

#### SKILL_SPEC
- **Skill Name**: Personal Question Generator
- **Description**: A skill that generates personalized questions based on user-provided information about their life experiences and preferences.

#### Code Snippet
```python
def generate_personal_question(user_info):
    questions = []
    
    # Example user_info could be a dictionary with keys like 'hobbies', 'memorable_events', 'favorite_places'
    if 'hobbies' in user_info:
        questions.append(f"What was the first hobby you ever pursued and why did you choose it?")
    
    if 'memorable_events' in user_info:
        questions.append(f"Can you describe a memorable event from your childhood that shaped who you are today?")
    
    if 'favorite_places' in user_info:
        questions.append(f"What is a place you visited that holds a special meaning to you, and what happened there?")
    
    # Return a random question from the generated list
    import random
    return random.choice(questions)

# Example usage
user_info = {
    'hobbies': ['painting', 'hiking'],
    'memorable_events': ['first school play', 'family road trip'],
    'favorite_places': ['Grand Canyon', 'local park']
}

personal_question = generate_personal_question(user_info)
print(personal_question)
```

This code defines a function that takes user information and generates a personalized question based on their unique experiences. The user can provide their information in a structured format, and the function will output a question that is tailored to them.
