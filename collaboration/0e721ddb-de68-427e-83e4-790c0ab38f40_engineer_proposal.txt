==================================================
**Analysis:**

The request is a simple inquiry about whether "Dexter" is currently working. This seems to be a conversational or status-check type of request. The context suggests that "Dexter" might be a virtual assistant or a system component that the user is trying to interact with. The request does not provide specific technical details or requirements, so the focus is on understanding the operational status of "Dexter."

**Approach:**

1. **Determine Context:** Clarify what "Dexter" refers to. It could be a software service, a chatbot, or a system component. Understanding this will guide the response.
   
2. **Check Status:** If "Dexter" is a system or service, the solution involves checking its operational status. This could be done through a status API, a health check endpoint, or a system log.

3. **Respond Appropriately:** Based on the status check, provide a response indicating whether "Dexter" is operational. If not, provide guidance on troubleshooting or next steps.

4. **User Interaction:** If "Dexter" is a conversational agent, ensure the response is friendly and informative.

**Implementation:**

Assuming "Dexter" is a service with an API to check its status, the implementation could look like this:

```python
import requests

def check_dexter_status():
    try:
        # Replace with the actual endpoint to check Dexter's status
        response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/dexter/status")
        if response.status_code == 200:
            status_info = response.json()
            if status_info.get('status') == 'operational':
                return "Dexter is currently working and operational."
            else:
                return "Dexter is currently not operational. Please try again later."
        else:
            return "Unable to determine Dexter's status at the moment."
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        return f"An error occurred while checking Dexter's status: {e}"

# Example usage
status_message = check_dexter_status()
print(status_message)
```

**Note:** This implementation assumes there is an API endpoint available to check the status of "Dexter." If such an endpoint does not exist, the approach would need to be adjusted based on how "Dexter's" status can be determined (e.g., system logs, service dashboard, etc.).
