==================================================
**Analysis:**

The request "Hello Dexter, are you working now?" appears to be a simple query to check the status or availability of a system or service named "Dexter." This could be a chatbot, a virtual assistant, or a software service. The request does not provide specific details about what "working" entails, so we need to interpret it as a general availability check.

**Approach:**

1. **Determine the Context**: Identify what "Dexter" refers to. If it's a service or a bot, we need to check its operational status.
2. **Check Availability**: Implement a mechanism to verify if Dexter is operational. This could involve:
   - Checking if the service is running.
   - Verifying connectivity to the service.
   - Ensuring that the service is responsive to requests.
3. **Respond Appropriately**: Provide a response that indicates whether Dexter is working, and if not, provide a reason or suggest troubleshooting steps.

**Implementation:**

To implement this, we need to create a simple status-checking mechanism. If Dexter is a web service, we can use a health check endpoint. If it's a local application, we might check for a running process or service status.

Here's a basic implementation outline in Python:

```python
import requests

def check_dexter_status():
    try:
        # Assuming Dexter has a health check endpoint
        response = requests.get("http://dexter-service/health")
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return "Dexter is working now."
        else:
            return "Dexter is not working. Status code: {}".format(response.status_code)
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        return "Dexter is not working. Error: {}".format(e)

# Example usage
status_message = check_dexter_status()
print(status_message)
```

**SKILL_SPEC (if needed):**

If Dexter is a more complex system requiring specific checks (e.g., database connectivity, API responsiveness), we might need to define a more detailed skill specification:

```yaml
SKILL_SPEC:
  name: DexterStatusChecker
  description: Checks the operational status of the Dexter service.
  inputs:
    - name: service_url
      type: string
      description: The URL of the Dexter service health endpoint.
  outputs:
    - name: status_message
      type: string
      description: A message indicating the operational status of Dexter.
  actions:
    - name: check_status
      description: Perform a health check on the Dexter service.
      implementation: |
        import requests

        def check_status(service_url):
            try:
                response = requests.get(service_url)
                if response.status_code == 200:
                    return "Dexter is working now."
                else:
                    return "Dexter is not working. Status code: {}".format(response.status_code)
            except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
                return "Dexter is not working. Error: {}".format(e)
```

This approach ensures we have a clear method to determine Dexter's status and provide feedback to the user.
