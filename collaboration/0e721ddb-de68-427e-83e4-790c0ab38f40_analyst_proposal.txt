==================================================
### Analysis
The user request is a simple inquiry asking if "Dexter" is currently working. This suggests a need for a status update or confirmation of availability. The request does not provide specific context or details about the nature of the work or tasks at hand, indicating that the user may be looking for a quick response rather than a detailed analysis.

### Approach
To address the user's request effectively, we can implement a straightforward response mechanism that confirms whether "Dexter" is operational and available for collaboration. This could involve:

1. Checking the current operational status of "Dexter."
2. Providing a clear and concise response indicating availability.
3. Optionally, offering further assistance or information if needed.

### Implementation
Since this request does not require a new skill but rather a simple status check, we can proceed with a basic implementation. Below is a SKILL_SPEC that outlines the necessary function for checking availability.

#### SKILL_SPEC
```python
class DexterAvailability:
    def __init__(self):
        self.is_working = True  # Assume Dexter is working by default

    def check_availability(self):
        if self.is_working:
            return "Yes, Dexter is currently working."
        else:
            return "No, Dexter is not available at the moment."

# Example usage
dexter = DexterAvailability()
response = dexter.check_availability()
print(response)  # Outputs: "Yes, Dexter is currently working."
```

This implementation provides a clear and direct response to the user's inquiry while allowing for easy updates to the availability status if necessary.
