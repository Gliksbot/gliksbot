==================================================
**Analysis:**

The request "Hello Dexter, are you working now?" seems to be a simple query to check the status or availability of an entity named "Dexter." This could be a chatbot, a service, or a system component. The request does not provide specific details about what "working" entails, so we need to interpret this as checking the operational status or availability of Dexter.

**Approach:**

1. **Identify Dexter's Nature**: Determine if Dexter is a chatbot, service, or system component. This will guide how we check its status.
   
2. **Status Check Mechanism**: Implement a mechanism to check Dexter's status. This could involve:
   - For a chatbot: Checking if it's online and responsive.
   - For a service: Verifying if it's running and healthy.
   - For a system component: Ensuring it's operational and not in an error state.

3. **Response Generation**: Based on the status check, generate an appropriate response indicating whether Dexter is working or not.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage scenarios where Dexter's status cannot be determined.

**Implementation:**

Assuming Dexter is a service, here is a basic implementation outline in Python using a hypothetical API endpoint to check its status:

```python
import requests

def check_dexter_status():
    try:
        # Assuming there's an API endpoint to check Dexter's status
        response = requests.get("http://dexter-service.local/status")
        if response.status_code == 200:
            status_info = response.json()
            if status_info.get("status") == "operational":
                return "Dexter is currently working."
            else:
                return "Dexter is not working at the moment."
        else:
            return "Unable to determine Dexter's status due to a server error."
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        return f"Error checking Dexter's status: {str(e)}"

# Example usage
status_message = check_dexter_status()
print(status_message)
```

**SKILL_SPEC (if needed):**

If Dexter's status requires a new skill or integration, define a `SKILL_SPEC` for interacting with the specific API or system component. This would include:

- **Skill Name**: DexterStatusChecker
- **Description**: A skill to check the operational status of Dexter.
- **Inputs**: API endpoint URL, authentication credentials (if needed).
- **Outputs**: Status message indicating Dexter's availability.
- **Dependencies**: `requests` library for HTTP requests.

This approach provides a structured way to determine Dexter's status and respond accordingly. Adjust the implementation details based on the actual nature and infrastructure of Dexter.
