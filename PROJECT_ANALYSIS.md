- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Database**: SQLite with full-text search capabilities
- **Configuration**: JSON-driven configuration system
- **Security**: Active Directory/LDAP integration with JWT authentication

#### Frontend (`/frontend/`)
- **Framework**: React 18 with Vite build system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for modern UI
- **State Management**: React hooks and context
- **Real-time**: Live updates for collaboration monitoring

#### Infrastructure
- **VM Platform**: Hyper-V with PowerShell Direct
- **Isolation**: Network-disconnected VMs for secure code execution
- **File Transfer**: Shared folder mechanism between host and VM
- **Deployment**: IIS-ready with SSL/TLS support

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Multi-LLM Collaboration System

The system's most innovative feature is its sophisticated LLM collaboration framework:

**Collaboration Workflow:**
1. **Immediate Broadcast**: User requests are instantly sent to all enabled LLMs
2. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple LLMs work simultaneously on proposals
3. **Peer Review**: LLMs read and critique each other's solutions
4. **Refinement Phase**: Solutions are improved based on peer feedback
5. **Democratic Voting**: Weighted voting determines the best solution
6. **Consensus Building**: System converges on optimal approach

**Supported LLM Providers:**
- OpenAI (GPT models)
- Nemotron (NVIDIA's enterprise AI)
- Ollama (Local model hosting)
- Extensible architecture for additional providers

### 2. Campaign Management System

Long-running autonomous operations through structured campaigns:

**Campaign Features:**
- **Objective Decomposition**: High-level goals broken into manageable tasks
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of completion status
- **Skill Association**: Automatic linking of generated skills to objectives
- **Autonomous Execution**: Self-directed operation over extended periods
- **Status Management**: Active, paused, completed, and failed states

**Database Schema:**
- Campaigns table with metadata and progress tracking
- Objectives table with status, timestamps, and skill assignments
- Campaign-skill associations for capability tracking

### 3. Secure Skill Creation Pipeline

Revolutionary approach to AI-generated code validation:

**Security Model:**
- **VM Isolation**: All code execution in network-disconnected VMs
- **PowerShell Direct**: Host-to-VM communication without network exposure
- **Mandatory Testing**: Code must pass tests before promotion
- **Skill Library**: Proven skills stored for reuse
- **Rollback Capability**: Failed skills provide feedback for improvement

**Skill Lifecycle:**
1. LLM collaboration generates code solution
2. Code transferred to isolated VM
3. Automated testing in secure environment
4. Success → Promotion to skill library
5. Failure → Feedback to LLMs for iteration

### 4. Enterprise Integration
